  <h1>Vacation is Hard</h1>

  
    <p style="font-size:90%;">Posted on <time datetime="2015-08-18T00:00:00+00:00">August 18, 2015</time></p>
  

  <p>...not necessarily because going on vacation is hard, but coming back from it? Oof.</p>
<p>I just spent 10 days camping without cell phone service at a spiritual retreat. Had a great time, hung out with friends that I only see once a year, and had some seriously knock-your-socks-off spiritual moments.</p>
<p>Then, the return to day-to-day &quot;normalcy&quot;. Usually it takes me a few hours, maybe a day at most to get back into the swing of things. For whatever reason this time? It's already a week and I'm still not back. And, when I say &quot;I'm not back&quot; what I mean is that my brain isn't working in normal mode yet. Here, let me give you an example.</p>
<p>When camping for 10 days with 200+ of your closest friends it's &quot;normal&quot; to have a 10'x10' popup structure for your kitchen, a 10'x20' carport for your living room, and have an 8 person tent for 2 people. This, of course, presents challenges. Things such as &quot;how do I keep water from dripping down between the kitchen and the living room&quot;.</p>
<p>The context switch between solving such physical, tangible, see-results-immediately problems and solving &quot;how do I connect to this database through a ssh tunnel again?&quot; is so massive I don't have words to describe it and I haven't been this tired in a long time. I've tried &quot;easing&quot; back into it and that failed pretty miserably when I couldn't remember half my passwords which immediately threw me into option 2 &quot;jumping into the deep end&quot; which also failed miserably.</p>
<p>What I can't get out of my head is what an amazing time I had camping and how much I wish I was right back up there. It's a calling on a deeply personal, spiritual level. Maybe the only answer is to try to rebuild that same experience here back in the &quot;real world&quot;.</p>
<p>Wish me luck...</p>
