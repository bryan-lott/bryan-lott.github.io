  <h1>2019 Year in Review</h1>

  <p>Apparently I missed doing one of these last year.  Oh well.  This year has been difficult and challenging and pretty amazing all rolled into one.  First, I read (and listened) to a lot more books than I realized.  That's amazing.  I grew up a voracious reader and somehow got out of the habit.  Needless to say, I think I'm back in the groove and just need to keep up the habit!</p>
<h2 id="books">Books</h2>
<h3 id="audio">Audio</h3>
<ul>
<li>It Burns (Marc Fennell)
<ul>
<li>Short and fascinating story about the hottest of the hot peppers.  Sounds boring I know, but I was pretty captivated on my way home from Burning Man by it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extreme Ownership (Leif Babin, Jocko Willink)
<ul>
<li>Pretty much required reading/listening if you're a leader in any capacity.  The intro and acknowledgements are pretty similar.  Don't hesitate fast forward through those and read them later.  To a non-military person it's very &quot;hoo-rah&quot; b.s. that detracts from the actual work itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Dichotomy of Leadership (Leif Babin, Jocko Willink)
<ul>
<li>While it would still make sense without the first book, I'd seriously consider reading Extreme Ownership first because this book builds on the last and does a deeper dive into the nuances of leadership and the balance therein.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Breath Becomes Air (Paul Kalanithi)
<ul>
<li>Wow.  This one is a hard read/listen.  Can't recommend it highly enough, but damn.  It really puts into perspective the fragility and strength of being human.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Crash Test Girl (Kari Byron)
<ul>
<li>This was a great read.  While I hesitate to compare it to Adam Savage's book (they were both MythBusters), it's really fun and I can't get enough of reading biographical-like books.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Everything is F*cked (Mark Manson)
<ul>
<li>Hold onto your seats for the (from my perspective) rapid left turn the end of the book makes.  Beyond that, there's a certain cadence to Manson's writing that I really enjoy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Every Tool's a Hammer (Adam Savage)
<ul>
<li>Can't say enough good about this book.  Savage is definitely someone I look up to and this is a fun, idiosyncratic look at his process, how he thinks about things, etc.  If nothing else, the chapter on lists and list making was potentially life-changing for me.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spy the Lie (Michael Floyd)
<ul>
<li>Was a bit disappointed in this sadly.  It's interesting, but I wouldn't go out of my way to re-listen to it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dead-tree">Dead-Tree</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every Tool's a Hammer (Adam Savage)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I listened to and read this book.  It's absolutely worth doing both.  I find I get better comprehension and retention by reading but listening to Adam really drove home his passion for making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What If? (Randall Munroe)
<ul>
<li>Anything by Munroe is considered mandatory ready for me.  Smart, funny, and just all around a good time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How To (Randall Munroe)
<ul>
<li>Same with this one.  Really hoping that Munroe continues to write books (and <a href="https://xkcd.com">XKCD</a> comics!)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deep Work (Cal Newport)
<ul>
<li>Newport puts into words very eloquently what I've felt for a long time about the kind of work that I do (software development) and exactly why open offices and manager schedules destroy my productivity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Street Freaks (Terry Brooks)
<ul>
<li>The last time I read Terry Brooks was probably in middle or high school with the Shannara books.  This is a complete depart from that to a cyber/bio punk future that I really enjoyed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The End of Night (Paul Bogard)
<ul>
<li>Very sad but meaningful read.  Definitely makes you wonder what else we've lost as a society as we've lost the night sky.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Burglar's Guide to the City (Manaugh)
<ul>
<li>A book that I'd wanted to read for quite some time, but sadly it didn't stick with me.  Definitely some interesting ways of looking at architecture but the book meandered a bit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Scene that Became Cities (Caveat Magister)
<ul>
<li>Started reading this at Burning Man this year and immediately stopped when I realized what I was doing (spectating instead of participating).  For anyone that wants to learn more about the culture and philosophy that underlies a lot of Burning Man, required reading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Outgrowing God (Richard Dawkins)
<ul>
<li>Honestly, I was hoping for more with this one.  It felt surprisingly shallow and uninspiring.  I've been slowly distancing myself from &quot;spiritual&quot; practices for some time now.  Mostly because I haven't been able to get much out of it.  I was hoping for more of a guide, I guess?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Practical Lock Picking (Deviant Ollam)
<ul>
<li>If you want to understand locks and how they provide only the facade of security in our world, mandatory reading.  Any talks by Deviant are also incredibly eye-opening and highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Simple Minded (Daniel Vincennie)
<ul>
<li>Not entirely sure if this is fiction, half fiction, or non fiction.  It felt like a fever dream and if that was the author's intention, it worked really well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide (James Fadiman)
<ul>
<li>Not just for psychadelic explorers, but helpful guide for anyone facing a different/difficult/challenging mindset or someone that wants to provide support to someone going through difficult &quot;stuff&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="podcasts">Podcasts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy Third
<ul>
<li>This podcast really got me through the year and was primarily responsible for giving me the confidence to go to Burning Man for the first time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Critical Role
<ul>
<li>I finally finished Campaign 1!  Looking to Campaign 2... I think I'm going to wait a bit before I dive back in.  Don't get me wrong, I love this podcast, but 3-4 hours per episode means there's not a lot of time for other listening.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Something Else
<ul>
<li>Brand new podcast, really looking forward to seeing where this goes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mormon and the Meth Head
<ul>
<li>Got turned onto this one by my significant other.  Haven't had as much time to listen to it as I'd like but it's highly recommended.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Important Thing
<ul>
<li>Rands in Repose's podcast.  Again, not as much time as I'd like to be able to listen to it.  It'll probably fill in at least some of the time that I was spending on Critical Role.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cool-stuff-done">Cool Stuff Done</h2>
<ul>
<li>Burning Man
<ul>
<li>Really deserves its own blog post/series.  Amazing and challenging in all the ways I needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>3D Printing
<ul>
<li>This is an entire hobby all its own.  Very cool technology that's coming up to the point where it's almost ready for a consumer audience, not just a hobby audience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>D&amp;D 5e
<ul>
<li>Continued playing awesome games with my (now) standard gaming group.  For anyone that hasn't played D&amp;D (or other tabletop role playing game) I highly recommend it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
