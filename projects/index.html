  <p>So, for whatever reason, I'm feeling inspired this morning.  Have a few projects in mind, some of which are ongoing, and others that are just a twinkle in my mind's eye.</p>
<ul>
<li>The &quot;perfect&quot; D&amp;D/RPG note taking system.  Something along the lines of bullet journal, customized for RPG <em>player</em> note taking.  Also, would love it if the character sheet was integrated into the system as well.  I picked up a Leuchtturm1917 note book last night and, with any luck, I'll be able to transfer notes from our previous sessions over to it within the next day or so and give it a real try out on Sunday when our game is.</li>
<li>Going to Burning Man.  Yeah, pretty simple.  Plan is to buy a ticket the first opportunity I can.  I think I've already got the survival situation pretty much figured out.  It definitely helps that my girlfriend and another friend went last year and I've been listening to the <em>awesome</em> <a href="https://accuracythird.com/">Accuracy Third Podcast</a> since the end of Burning Man last year.</li>
<li>Building a Burning Man Art Car.  Apparently, I'm supposed to wait until my sophomore year before I start getting wild-ass ideas about building shit at BM.  I'm in sort of a weird space though, in some ways, I kinda feel like last year (2018) was my first year, I just didn't go physically.  I'm probably full of shit about this but we'll see.</li>
<li>Writing every day.  I'm doing relatively well on this so far.  Not necessarily writing every day, but writing on a regular basis.  Publishing what I've written to my blog as long as it's not too personal.  So far, so good.  Don't want to jinx it though!</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what projects are you working on?  What projects are floating around in your head that you haven't gotten started?  What projects <em>could</em> you be working on if only you had time/energy/money/motivation/etc?</p>
