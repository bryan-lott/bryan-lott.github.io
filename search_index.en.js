other blogs, I'm doing \"2017 in review\".&nbsp; It gives me something to blog about and might jump start a new habit of writing more often.&nbsp; Daily blogging would be fantastic but I'd like to start with something reasonable, monthly or maybe weekly and work up from there...\nNote, after writing this it completely changed my perspective on how 2017 went for me.&nbsp; When I originally started I was feeling pretty shitty about 2017 and hoping that 2018 is better.&nbsp; Yeah, there was a lot of \nnegativity in 2017 but personally there was a lot of good in there too.&nbsp; Funny how things get put into perspective sometimes.\nGames Played\nBoard/Tabletop\n\nUnearth\n\nFantastic \"light\" board game for up to 4 players that plays in about 45 minutes or so.&nbsp; Make sure to read the rules closely as our first game left us feeling a bit \"WTF?\"\nGreat for introducing parents and family members to a board game that's not one of the U.S. classics (Clue, Monopoly, etc).\n\n\nNumenera\n\nThere's going to be a lot about this in the RPG section, but I can't say enough for how much this game has changed my life for the better.\n\n\n\nVideo\n\nDivinity Original Sin\n\nMy new favorite game.&nbsp; Really great classic role-playing game (CRPG) with what seem to be meaningful choices, a crafting system, magic, freedom of character creation and pathing, etc.&nbsp; Feels close to D&amp;D which is pretty much what I've been looking for.\n\n\nPath of Exile\n\nThink Diablo II, but better, and free.&nbsp; Definitely worth a couple hours to figure out if you like it or not.\n\n\nCrosscode\n\nFeels like playing a realtime-combat JRPG MMO, but it's a single-player game.&nbsp; Fantastic for the anti-social types that want to solo a cute MMO.\n\n\nTurmoil\n\nGreat little time-waster with surprising depth (no pun intended LOL!)\n\n\nRunning With Rifles\n\nGreat time-waster, can be a bit frustrating at points, but the initial campaign is pretty long and engaging as are several of the player-created campaigns.\n\n\nRebel Galaxy\n\nThis game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in a game.&nbsp; Feels like a wonderful mashup of Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, and soloing Eve: Online.&nbsp; I only wish the storyline was a bit longer and you could spend more time with the higher level ships.\n\n\n\nBooks Read/Listened To\nFiction\n\nPromise of Blood (Powder Mage #1)\n\nReally engaging story so far, I'm about 7 chapters or so in and can't stop reading.\n\n\nEngineering Infinity\n\nFirst few stories were really amazing, the next ones I seem to have gotten bogged down in.&nbsp; Will maybe try this again once I finish the first Powder Mage book.\n\n\nLegends of the Nameless Dwarf: The Complete Saga\n\nHaven't touched this since I finished the first book toward the startof the year.&nbsp; The worldbuilding is interesting but seems a little disjointed for my taste.&nbsp; I'll likely come back to it at some point.\n\n\nThe Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles #1)\n\nThe prose of this book is amazing but I find that it sometimes gets in the way of a story that's not incredibly interesting to me.&nbsp; I'm more interested in the nested way the stories are being told (The author is telling the story of a storyteller telling a story about himself who also sometimes tells a story).\n\n\nVurt\n\nIf you can handle the (sometimes very) mature themes in here, it's a fun, wild ride.\n\n\nNorse Mythology\n\nFirst book on Norse mythology that I've actually finished.&nbsp; If I remember correctly, this one was an audiobook read by the author.\n\n\nPriest (Ratcatchers #1)\n\nMatthew Colville, if you don't know that name, you probably don't play any tabletop role playing games (TTRPGs).  He has a fantastic youtube channel devoted to nothing but and is engaging and fun to listen to.  I originally bought this book as well as Thief to support him and it was surprisingly good.  If I remember correctly there are a few very minor editing mistakes but I highly recommend it.\n\n\nThief (Ratcatchers #2)\n\nThe only bad thing about the Ratcatchers #2 is there isn't a #3 yet!!!\n\n\nThe Night Clave\n\nGreat Numenera novel, required reading for Numenera GM's in my opinion.\n\n\nMyth of the Maker\n\nTo be honest, I never finished this one.  The Strange is an interesting concept but I just can't get into it for some reason.\n\n\n\nNon-fiction\n\nCoders at Work\n\nI've made it through the first interview at this point and it's engaging enough to keep reading once I make the time for non-fiction.\n\n\nExtreme Ownership\n\nReally made me take a hard look at leadership, my own role in failures, and what kind of leader I want to aspire to be.\n\n\nRework\n\nBunch of good tidbits in here, even for people that may not be running their own business.\n\n\nThe Passionate Programmer\n\nSome of this book, I had an initially negative reaction to.&nbsp; Mostly the \"think like a business person\" stuff.&nbsp; In my \"perfect\" world, I'd just be writing code.&nbsp; The business world doesn't follow the same \nlogical rules I'm used to thinking in, which makes it rather difficult for me.&nbsp; Thus, it's a learning opportunity.\n\n\nThe Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains\n\nFrightening book.&nbsp; This is the one book this year that terrified me for the future of not only my own brain but the brains of the IT industry as well as for the developed (and soon enough developing) \nworld.\nInspired me to read more, both paper books as well as on Kindle and listen to more.\n\n\nWhere Good Ideas Come From\n\nGreat audiobook for my now ~2 hour daily commute.  Engaging enough to keep your interest, but not so engaging that you forget you're driving!\n\n\nHow We Got to Now\n\nSame as the above, another great audiobook for a commute.\n\n\nThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\n\nRequired reading, in my opinion, for anyone that says \"yes\" to too many things.\n\n\nThe Design of Everyday Things\n\nHaven't finished this one yet, but it's already fascinating.\n\n\n\nTabletop Role-Playing Game (TTRPG)\nI read a lot of RPG books, not necessarily because I'm going to play that particular setting/game/etc, but because it might provide a new perspective on how to better run a particular situation, give me inspiration, or offer another tool I can throw in my GM's toolbox (clocks from Blades in the Dark as one example).\nThis is what I can remember I've read this year.&nbsp; It's been a lot...\n\nRyuutama\n\nI've seen it described as Miyazaki-meets-Oregon-Trail.&nbsp; Great RPG focused on the journey of a character and the stories they tell.&nbsp; Definitely worth a read even if you never play it as inspiration for how to make the journeys of your character/player richer.\n\n\nCypher System\n\nNumenera\n\nJade Colossus: Ruins of Prior Worlds\n\nI'm not sure if this counts as a setting book but it definitely expands the setting of Numenera providing an interesting large structure to explore and set adventures in.&nbsp; More than that, it provides a \"ruin\" generator that's fantastic (and is screaming for someone to create an online generator).&nbsp; Great book, well worth purchasing.\n\n\nShadewalker\n\nLooks to be a great one-shot adventure and one for getting new players up and running.&nbsp; It's small enough that it can be placed pretty much anywhere in the Ninth World and would be easy to continue on from.\n\n\nNinth World Bestiary 2\n\nTo be honest, there wasn't a whole lot here.&nbsp; I love the idea of bestiaries as inspiration and to give you more and varied creatures to throw at players.&nbsp; The thing is, Numenera isn't supposed to be heavily combat focused and a lot of the creatures seem to be targets to swing at, not encounters to be role-played.\n\n\nIn Alternate Dimensions\n\nHave already used The Whispering World alternate reality for my ongoing campaign and it's worked out incredibly well.&nbsp; Would definitely recommend if you're interested in ramping up the Weird factor.\n\n\nCharacter Options 2\n\nFantastic.&nbsp; I'd consider this a must-buy along with Character Options 1.&nbsp; Adds new player classes and a ton of other options.\n\n\n\n\nUnmasked\n\nRetro 80's setting, Superhero RPG.\nTo be honest, other than it being a cypher system setting, nothing else appeals to me in this book.&nbsp; It's definitely a lot different than what was represented in the Kickstarter and I'm disappointed.&nbsp; That being said, there are a ton of reviews I've read online about how people love the setting and gameplay so more power to 'em.&nbsp; It's just not for me.\n\n\nPredation\n\nSeems like a great setting and provides some very interesting options for companion beasties.&nbsp; The roleplaying potential here is fantastic as the beasties are all played by someone who isn't their human companion.&nbsp; They also come with personalities and numerous other fun tidbits.\n\n\nExpanded Worlds\n\nTo be honest, this one was pretty meh for me.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll mine it for info if I get bored with Numenera and want to world build.\n\n\nVurt\n\nThis setting book is gorgeous and jam-packed full of information, inspiration, and details about Manchester.\nBest of all, it seems like it's written in the Gamecat's voice, so I was reading it in that voice (from the audiobook) the entire time.&nbsp; I highly recommend this, kittlings.\nHaving read the novel I was glad to see the sex-focused bits of the Vurt world entirely optional or turned down a bit.&nbsp; If your gaming group can handle it, great, but I haven't even heard of one that can.\n\n\n\n\nBlades in the Dark\n\nInteresting system and world wrapped into a book that's a little disjointed.  I'd recommend it for more experienced GM's and players as it's at best a morally ambiguous setting and game play with the potential to experience a lot of interesting and potentially uncomfortable situations.\nAs a GM the \"clocks\" mechanic is very interesting and one that I'll likely steal for any other game I end up running.\n\n\nDungeon World\n\nHaven't played this yet, but it looks to be a great system for new players and GM's.  It provides a limited list of \"moves\" for both the GM and the players and yet provides a ridiculous amount of freedom inside those moves.\n\n\nParanoia\n\nWould love to play this in the future, not much to say here other than the \"secret traitor\" bit is definitely interesting.\n\n\n\nTTRPG's\nCritical Role!\nHaving listened to the Critical Role podcast for a good portion of this year's commutes into and home from work, Matt is a GM god and has become someone that I can look up to, honestly.  He's humble, interesting, engaging, talented, and has a lot of life wisdom.\nThe rest of the cast is similarly amazing and has likely been responsible for a good portion of the uptick in people playing D&amp;D and other RPGs.\nCritical Role has been such a positive influence on me that I started running my own Numenera campaign and so far it's been a resounding success.  We've played approximately every 2 weeks for a good portion of the year now and one of my players has been inspired to run their own game!  It's awesome to see one of your players take the GM's mantle and run with it!  I'm currently playing in that game now and while she has a different style than myself, it's an awesome game!\nAnother interesting side effect of playing Numenera is that my woodshop/workshop area is much improved and organized.&nbsp; Stay with me on this one.\nI was looking for a good way to thank my players for sticking with me for the past however long we've bee playing as I GM'd my first real campaign.&nbsp; After a lot of browsing on Reddit, YouTube, and others I decided to get them a set of dice boxes.&nbsp; But, me being me, I can't just buy something.&nbsp; It has to have a personal touch somehow.&nbsp; So, I ended up going down the route of buying some cheap boxes from a craft store.&nbsp; Then I set to work sanding, distressing, finishing, staining, and felting the boxes.\nBefore I could do this, however, I needed a space to work in.&nbsp; The logical space was my \"workshop\", or better known as \"the place where we put shit when we don't know what to do with it.\"&nbsp; Que a 4 hour cleanup, organization, and trash music-montage.&nbsp; Is the workspace perfect?&nbsp; Hell no.&nbsp; The better question is: \"Is it functional enough?\"&nbsp; The answer to that one is a resounding yes.&nbsp; I was able to finish the boxes and give them as gifts (along with dice) to my players.\nSo, not only was I able to start 2 different projects (boxes and workshop cleanup), I was actually able to finish them as well!&nbsp; Nothing feels better to me than a project started and finished.\nColorado 4x4 Rescue and Recovery (CO4x4RnR)\nThis year I joined a 4x4 non-profit.&nbsp; Their (our) focus is person and vehicle extraction in the Colorado high country.&nbsp; Specifically on Forest Service roads and Jeep trails.\nMy first recovery happened at the end of January.&nbsp; I went on as a \"ride-along\" to see if it was for me \nand to get my feet wet.&nbsp; Well, the next month I spent close to $8,000 in upgrades to my Jeep to get it ready for recoveries.&nbsp; Talk about jumping in with both feet!&nbsp; In training and gear alone this year, I've probably\nspent over $10,000.&nbsp; I can also say that the 20+ recoveries I've been on have saved our clients well over that amount, possibly many times.&nbsp; On one recovery alone, the client was quoted $7,000 from a commercial towing company.\nSince that time I've joined the newly-formed SAR-ES (Search and Rescue - Emergency Support) group inside CO4x4RnR, learned Wilderness First Aid (WFA), taken 2 separate recovery skills classes, gained at least one 4x4 mentor, and made some great friends.&nbsp; It's also gotten me out in nature more in one year than in the past 10 years combined.&nbsp; That alone was worth it for my mental health.\nAnother project I was able to finish was the installation of some amber warning lights.&nbsp; They're currently installed in a temporary-but-functional sense which for now is good enough.&nbsp; That seems to be a theme for the past year and especially the last couple of months.&nbsp; \"Perfect is the enemy of the good.\"&nbsp; So, don't try to make things perfect.&nbsp; Instead, make them good enough and get. them. done.\nNew Job\nOn top of everything else, I also started a new job.  Having gotten fed up with the lack of progress in my previous job as well as rats leaving what started to feel like a sinking ship, I looked for and found a new job within about a month.  Changing jobs has always been stressful for me as I'm sure it is for many people.  Thankfully, the new company has a much healthier culture, one where they're not likely to lay off people or sell a good portion of the company on what feels like a whim.\nThere are a few warning signs with the new company but as a rule, I don't talk about my current employer publicly, so my strategy right now is to adopt a wait-and-see approach.  What that means is that I keep working as hard as I can to do my job right and if the company fails me, or a better opportunity arises, well, I'll move on to another.\nSadly the days of working for a company for 10+ years are far behind us, especially in the tech industry.  Don't get me wrong, if I found the right company, I'd stick with them until whatever retirement looks like in 20+ years.  The problem is I don't know that company even exists.\nSummary\nSo, to sum up, personally I've had a fantastic year.  I'm hoping and working toward 2018 being even better.  Some things that are on my list:\n\nDo more functional programming, preferably getting paid to do it!\nRead more books, fiction and non-fiction, especially the dead-tree variety.\nPlay more games!  Specifically tabletop games (RPG or not) with friends.  The human connection is hard to beat.\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/2017-recap/","title":"2017 Recap"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/about/":{"body":"Why (import this)?\nimport this is an easter egg in Python and I love the playfulness.

It used to only apply to curmudgeonly sysadmins and the neckbeard elite but I've noticed lately that it can be applied to a large number of other IT professionals. Specifically, I'm talking about developers.\nI know you have to sit in your cube staring at page after page of incomprehensible piles of crap code written by someone else that clearly didn't know what they were doing. I know that you have to spend hours with a debugger to find a misspelling in a string variable's value. I know that it can take a day and a half to find the missing semicolon that's been causing compiler errors. I know that it makes you want to defenestrate your laptop, cubicle, mouse, keyboard, and anything else within arm's reach.\nHow do I know this? I do it all day too and it drives me up the wall probably just as much if not more than it does you.\nHere's the thing my fellow developers. Users, sysadmins, managers, and other devs are NOT out to get you. They are not out to make your life a living hell, nor are they trying to get your job. In fact, most of them probably wouldn't want your job if you offered it to them on a silver platter. Remember, you make things happen. That's a huge power and a huge responsibility and most people don't want either. But, I digress. Users, sysadmins, managers, and other devs are people, just like you. They have just as hard of a time understanding the meatbag sitting in a cubicle staring at \"gibberish\" (and occasionally writing some) as you do understanding the meatbag that seems to have a job consisting of nothing but meeting people. A smile, friendly hello, or 30 seconds taken to listen to a problem can go a long way toward building common understanding and a good working relationship.\nSo, here's my personal guide to working well with others:\n\nBe nice to people, you'd be amazed at how you can get along if you follow a potentially negatively misinterpretable comment with a smiley face :) (but the thing is, you actually have to mean the smiley face)\nYou are not your code. Sure, you wrote it, does it define you as a person? I sure hope not because I know I've written some really crappy code and I don't want it defining me! If someone wants to throw it out in favor of something better, let me grab the trashcan and hold it for 'em.\nCondescension kills. Do not, under any circumstances, no matter what the situation (even if they're a drooling idiot) act in a condescending manner to anyone. Basically you wouldn't want someone else treating you like you're an idiot for not knowing that rm -rf / will blow up your linux box. Remember, at some point, you. did. not. know. what. you. know. now!\nIf you're not in person, over communicate. Most communication mediums have a way of ignoring someone if they're too communicative. But, as a dev, chances are you're on the under-communication end of the spectrum.\nIf you're absolutely right, there's a good chance you missed something. Basically, you're never right all the time, and if you are, your career is over because you've stopped learning. Never stop learning and never stop being wrong. (this also helps when debugging... \"print\" rarely breaks, but the code you just introduced breaks more often than you think ;) )\nListen to people. And when I say listen I don't mean \"wait for your turn to speak.\" I mean really listen, understand what they're saying and try to figure out their motivation for saying it.\nAsk questions more than make statements. It's much easier to hear \"Was there a reason you left a debug print statement in?\" than \"Don't leave debug print statements in!\" It's giving them the benefit of the doubt, but make sure you don't sound condescending when you ask.\n\nIn closing, don't be a BOFH. Nobody likes them and while being the outcast was cool in high school, it doesn't work as a career.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/bofh/","title":"BOFH"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/burnout/":{"body":"Burnout ...and possibly how to defend against it.\nA little bit of backstory is probably in order.  For me, burnout has never been a problem until this past month.  Working on a migration from a data center to the cloud that's run over 6 months of constant work has gotten me pretty fried.  We're nearly at the end and I feel like I've gained quite a bit of perspective on this problem, at least for myself.  I feel like I'm actually in a decent place to talk about how I prevented total burnout/quitting/etc and maybe what I've learned can help someone else (including myself, the next time I'm facing burnout).\nFirst off, there are two things that I believe contribute to burnout.  Time sinks and mental energy sinks.  Context switching is a great example of a time sink.  We all know that we lose at least 15 minutes of productive time when we context switch.  What we don't always realize is how much mental energy we spend.  Burnout happens when we either have no more time or no more mental energy.  Time can be recovered by extending deadlines, having other knowledgeable people help on the problem, etc.  Mental energy however is being constantly drained while working on a given problem.  For me, I find very few ways to recover that energy, none of which are quick.  So, what we have are two ways of preventing burnout:\n\nReduce mental energy drain\nReplenish mental energy\n\nLet's tackle the reduce problem first.\nReducing Mental Energy Drain\nSupport System\nHaving a good, solid support system of friends, family, and coworkers is the first thing that helped me prevent mental drain.  Knowing that someone has your back when you're spending all of your mental energy fighting through an obscure bug in a complex ETL system that's been mangled and munged just to get it working is shockingly helpful.  Just as having an significant other that understands why you're mubling under your breath at the dinner table and get up in the middle of eating because you just had a breakthrough can save your sanity and your relationship.\nTooling\nAny tool you currently use that adds to your cognative load or adds barriers to solving problems needs to be thrown out a window, right now.  You're not doing yourself any favors by using something that's not quite good enough or even \"good enough\".  Your tools are extensions of your brain and anything that's standing in the path between your brain and the solution to your problem needs to help, not hinder.  Everything from the keyboard you type on, to the headphones you use to stay focused, to the text editor you write blog posts in.  Everything matters.  So much so that you, right now, need to take a good hard look at the tools you use and identify any that are problematic.  No, I really mean that, go do it now.  I'll wait.\nBreaking down problems\nThe brain can only handle so much at any given time, so, to prevent mental drain, give it less to chew on.  If you have a large problem, first, document what the problem is.  Then, if it's still to large, start breaking it down into managable chunks, documenting each of those and then take them one by one.  I guarantee it'll be easier than trying to tackle the entire thing, all at once.\nReplenishing Mental Energy\nPlay\nHopefully you have an office as relaxed as mine as I find that shooting one another with nerf guns and having impromteau \"nerf wars\" is a huge stress relief and a way to remember that your coworkers are just as stressed as you are and that they're just as human, childish, and fun as you are.  Failing that, make time to go do something fun, whether that's gardening, 4-wheeling, or just going for a walk in the park.\nGet away from the computer\nNo, seriously.  The more time I spend with computers, the more I've come to realize that I need time away from them.  If you're under a deadline, this \"time away\" definitely comes at a premium, but is vital to replenish some of your mental energy.  Bonus points if it happens to be something physical.  Several things that have worked for me have been tai-chi, woodworking, yard work (no, really!  I actually find that mowing the lawn is a very meditative act), and reading a good novel (no technical books!!!).\nMeditation\nFor me, this consists of either mindfulness walking or of the \"classic\" meditation of emptying my mind.  I'm not sure why this is so helpful to me, but it always seems to allow me to regain focus and just be able to think clearly again.  Your mileage may vary.\nExercise\nOkay, so this is something that I'm pretty terrible at being consistent.  That being said, having some sort of exercise (even if it's just going for a 30 minute walk) can be incredible helpful in recharging your mental energy.  I've found, personally, that I need to have a good balance between the physical and mental aspects of my life and if I don't have at least a walk every other day, I end up being more mentally exhausted than I \"should be\".\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/burnout/","title":"Burnout"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/concurrency-part-2/":{"body":"Wow, even trivial concurrency in Python is hard...\nSo, you have a list of tasks that you want to consume lazily (as they're generated, so you don't blow up memory).  Great!  That's easy to do with a generator function using the yield keyword or the (syntax).  But, oh no... you can't pass that to a multiprocess function because it's not picklable.  Drat!\nNext, you go down the road of:\np.map(worker, itertools.islice(generator_function, slice_size))\n\nWhich is great, until you want to lazily push results back to the main process because that work now blows up memory.\nfor block in p.imap(worker, itertools.islice(generator_function, slice_size)):\n    do_additional_work()\n\nThe above won't work because again, generator functions aren't picklable so you have to return result sets from the worker function instead of being able to yield rows back.\nSo, you end up shoving as much as you can into the worker function so that you don't have to deal with passing large chunks of work back and forth.  I'm sorry, but this is a terrible state of things.  I'm sure there's libraries that help to ease this pain but my point is there shouldn't NEED to be libraries.  This should be core python.

The hazard that comes with running pool.map(function, list) if the list has unpickleable items in it is another roadblock in front of multiprocessing.\nMoore's law is only being kept by increasing the number of cores on each processor and if Python doesn't figure out how to easily multithread/multiprocess eventually it's going to fall behind in the race for speed.\nOf course, this leads me to my favorite new programming language, Clojure. The ease of multithreading is incredible:\n;; singlethreaded\n(map function list)\n\n;; multithreaded\n(pmap function list)\n\nProgramming in a multithreaded way is incredibly easy because you're already coding in a functional style which lends itself very easily to being multithreaded. Reasoning about code is so much simpler and as incidental complexity increases, I think languages like Clojure that are functional and multithreaded will only gain mindshare. They're easier to reason about as problem complexity increases without increasing incidental complexity significantly while maintaining a sustainable speed.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/concurrency/","title":"Concurrency"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/csv-primer/":{"body":"Parsing certain data formats can be more challenging than others.  One of the granddaddy's of challenging file formats is the humble CSV or \"comma separated value\" file (I've also heard \"character separated value\").  The lack of a strong specification as well as adherance to a specification is what makes parsing these files particularly challenging at times.\nGiven the experiences I've had over the past few months parsing over 40 different source file formats, here's a few ways to not make your own (or other) developer's pull all their hair out.\nFor the record, I've seen all of these in the wild.\nOne record per row\nSeriously.  There's a reason why I'm putting this first.  I don't care if the row has 2 columns or 500, but if you're spreading records over multiple rows, everyone involved is going to have a bad time.\nBad:\nid,title,image,image_position\n1,dining room table,image1,1\n1,,image2,3\n1,,image3,2\n\nBetter:\nid,title,images\n1,dining room table,image1,image3,image2\n\nAlso Better:\nid,title,images\n1,dining room table,\"image1,image3,image2\"\n\nAlso also better:\nid,title,image1,image2,image3,image4,image5\n1,dining room table,image1,image3,image2,,\n\nOne file\nTrust me, it's much easier to parse records when they're all in the same file and not spread out over, say, a \"data\" file, \"price\" file, and \"inventory level\" file.  All the data in one place.\nHave a header\nIf there's no header, we don't know what your data is.\nHave the header be the first line\nIf it's not the first line, it can be worked around in most cases, but that's additional customization, which introduces fragility.\nEach row should have the same number of fields as the header\nHopefully self-explanatory\nBad:\nid,title,image\n1,stuffed bear\n\nAlso Bad:\nid,title,image\n1,stuffed bear,image1,image2\n\nBest:\nid,title,image\n1,stuffed bear,\n2,table,image1\n\nDelimiters\nLong story short, I don't care which one you use, but use one that's not used in your data.  For instance, if your data has commas, maybe don't use them as a field separator?\nBad:\ntesting,1,2,3,what are we having, adam, for lunch?\n\nBest:\ntesting, 1, 2, 3|what are we having, adam, for lunch?\n\nQuoting\nIf you must use a delimiter that your data also contains, quote the fields and be consistent.  Yes, I realize most csv parsers can handle some fields being quoted and others not, but it does make things a headache if something goes wrong.\nFor the love of everything that is holy, do NOT use smart quotes as delimiters!!!  Especially if you use smart quotes in your data!\nBad:\ntesting,1,2,3,what are we having, adam, for lunch?\n\nSo, so, so bad:\n“testing,1,2”,3,“what are we having, adam, for lunch?”\n\nBetter:\n\"testing,1,2\",3,\"what are we having, adam, for lunch?\"\n\nBest:\n\"testing,1,2\",\"3\",\"what are we having, adam, for lunch?\"\n\nLine Endings\nThis is what determines where a new line/record starts.\nPlease please please use just \\n for a line ending, \\r\\n works too.  If you must, use just \\r.  Finally, don't mix them, please!\nEncoding\nIt seems like the world is starting to standardize on UTF-8.  Means you should probably do the same.  Multiple encodings means the parser has to try the most common first, if that fails, try a fallback, etc.  This has both data quality and performance implications.  Neither of which you want.\nEntire Data Set vs. Update\nThis gets into the weeds a bit, but providing all the data all the time is the easiest way to both provide and parse data.  It allows whomever you're sending the data to reprocess the entire dataset if something goes wrong.\nThat being said, if the data is truly immense (gigabytes or terabytes of data), I'd recommend an interval setup.  Basically every so often send the entire data set, and in the meantime, send only the records that have changed, BUT, send the entire record, not just the data in the record that changed.\nDeletes\nThis is probably the hardest bit to handle.  I've seen two ways to handle it and both have their advantages and drawbacks.  In my experience, the \"Absence Indicates Delete\" tends to be less error prone as long as the consumer is handling unexpected source files appropriately.\nFor the engineers reading this, it's the difference between the transfer of an entire system of state (single file) vs. state with multiple inputs that can get out of sync (delete file).\nAbsence Indicates Delete\nBasically if a record that already exists on the consumer of the csv isn't included in the provided csv it's deleted (or marked for delete or hidden, I'm treating these conditions the same for this post).\nThis has the advantage of not having to parse an additional file.\nThe disadvantage is that if either the csv file provided isn't what's expected or something goes wrong on the consumer side, an entire dataset can be deleted.\nDelete-only File\nEssentially this file would be a list of the records to be deleted.\nHas the advantage of being less error prone if the source csv is bad in some way.\nThe disadvantage here is twofold.

The simplicity of syntax and concept draws me like a moth to a flame.  It wouldn't be too far to say it's my favorite language and I never have the option of developing anything in it.\nI started with Clojure several years ago when I got fed up with the Python threading/multiprocessing pain.  While it wasn't exactly the easiest language to learn, the community and the resources available online made the transition reasonably painless.  I also probably have an advantage that I was never formally trained in object oriented principals or design and most of my training was either self driven or on the job so switching from object oriented to functional was much easier.\nHowever, I've wanted to use Clojure on a daily basis in my role as a programmer almost since I started learning it.  My team, management, and other developers, however, constantly push back on it because \"it looks weird.\"  Not kidding, that's a direct quote.\n\nMy frustration with this was building on a daily basis.  It was triggered moreso because of the simplicity of the issue.  99% of the pushback against Clojure was due to the parentheses being on the left side of the function:\n# this was deemed to be simpler/easier to read\n\"\\t\".join([str(i) for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0])\n\n'0\\t2\\t4\\t6\\t8\\t10\\t12\\t14\\t16\\t18\\t20\\t22\\t24\\t26\\t28\\t30\\t32\\t34\\t36\\t38\\t40\\t42\\t44\\t46\\t48\\t50\\t52\\t54\\t56\\t58\\t60\\t62\\t64\\t66\\t68\\t70\\t72\\t74\\t76\\t78\\t80\\t82\\t84\\t86\\t88\\t90\\t92\\t94\\t96\\t98'\n\n;; than this\n(clojure.string/join\n  \"\\tab\"\n  (filter even?

Tell me again about how many more parentheses there are in Clojure?\nIn addition, if you can't move the opening paren to the left side of the function and still read it, you've got bigger problems than what I can fix:\nstr(1)\n\"1\"\n\n(str 1)\n\"1\"\n\nYes, I realize that these are both contrived examples, but they illustrate the core point of my frustration.  Clojure is not harder to read, it's different.  And if you can't or don't want to learn something new then you're in the wrong profession.\n\nSo, because no one else was interested in learning it or supporting it in production, to ease the discomfort I was feeling with being stuck, I forged ahead anyway.  But, I did so with caution and pragmatism.  We had a very small issue that was plaguing us for some time.  A Python process would every once in a while log a traceback.  We had no out of the box way of getting at the full text of those tracebacks in any of our metrics, logging, or reporting tools as Python tracebacks span multiple lines.  In addition, the process would retry a given number of times so not all tracebacks should be pushed to the visibility of the engineering team, necessitating some custom logic.  The existing alerting pushed notifications to Slack, but without the full text of the traceback and it pushed all tracebacks, not just the critical failures and left out some important debugging details.\nAs an isolated, non-mission critial (the other alerts would continue as-is for some time) task, this seemed like a perfect location to introduce Clojure as a solution.\nGithub: Tracebackfilter\nIt's now been in production for close to 2 months now and has been working like a charm.  In addition, no one has derided the fact that it's written in Clojure.  Not only did I really enjoy writing it, it's become a gateway for showing other people what Clojure looks like that's actually in production!\n\nBuild what you love, even if it goes against the grain, but do it pragmatically.

Today?  The reason why you're reading a blog and not reading/writing code? ;)\nWe programmers reach for complexity like it’s goddamn instinctual.\nWait, let me back up. What is complexity?\nAccording to Rich Hickey, it’s the interweaving/interleaving/braiding of things. For instance, if you have a function with “and” in the name, you’re complecting (adding complexity to) the function. It should be separate functions.\nI just mentioned functions… not methods. Classes, for instance, complect data and operations on data (functions). According to the object-oriented tradition, this is a good thing. It provides encapsulation and a whole slew of other things.  Sometimes this is necessary and sometimes not.  When was the last time you wrote a class where the class was the only thing that operated on its internal state?  You may have started out with good intentions for that class, but you know what they say about the road to hell.\nBut, where am I going with this? Complexity == bad, simplicity == good? Well, yeah, I doubt anyone is going to disagree with that, but let’s dive in a bit deeper.\nHow many things can you hold in your head at one time? A common accepted value is 7 +/- 2 [citation needed]. Great, but that’s for digits, integers, very simple concepts. How many variables can you keep in your head? How much state? How many classes operating on one another at the same time? I’m guessing a lot fewer than 7 unless you’re extraordinary and then you might hit 7. But the thing is, that’s not much different than hitting 2. It’s not an order of magnitude better. So what do we do?\n“Well, then we reach for abstractions!” you, imaginary person on the other side of this conversation, say.\nGreat, abstractions. In theory they sound like the silver bullet. If I create a container that encapsulates a ton of other things, then I’ve reduced the number of things I need to keep track of. One problem though, abstractions tend to be leaky.\nHow many of them are leaky? Hah! Trick question! All of them! What do I mean by leaky though? It’s pretty simple; an abstraction leaks when you need to know something about the underlying implementation. That’s it. And that’s why abstractions can be so difficult to deal with. Needing to keep the underlying implementation details in your head on top of the local state and it’s no wonder we write buggy, broken code.\nTwo of my favorite abstractions to reach for in this discussion are SQL and ORM's.  In theory, ORM's make your life soooo much easier!  Instead of writing SQL you just use the framework's classes.  Until you can't.  Either due to performance or a complex business requirement, you have to drop down to SQL.  Bam, the abstraction has leaked as is no longer relevant.  And, since you know this is likely to happen in most use-cases for ORM's, why pick one up in the first place?  Because it's easy and who doesn't want easy?  In my opinion, a large number of \"easy\" abstractions get you nothing, all they do is kick the can a little further down the road. At some point, you’ve gotta pick up the can and figure out where it came from.\nSo, what do we do? My answer is look to the data that we’re schlepping around. When you boil down what developers do, we manipulate data. That’s it. Whether that data comes in the form of submitted form data, a stream of stock market prices, or a timer timing out. It’s all data. That’s it. Data.\nSo why are we building (leaky!) abstractions misdirections to hide the data from us? I spent two weeks, that I’m never getting back by the way, adding an extractor/mapper/persister to an existing microservice. This microservice was already consuming JSON, was already mapping other bits of the JSON, and was already persisting the mapped bits to a database.\nTWO WEEKS. To persist an extra bit of the exact same JSON.\nMaybe I’m a terrible dev, it’s possible. Or maybe we, as an industry, are drowning in complexity we added ourselves in the hopes that we’d be able to keep more things in our head at once. I’m sure we had great reasons at the time to reach for complexity in the name of \"easy\". Business constraints, feature requests, broken code, etc.\n\n“No matter how far you have gone on the wrong road, turn back.” Turkish Proverb [citation needed]\n\nAgain, it all goes back to data. A new/old concept seems to be rising up again. Data Driven Development. Think about that for a minute. What it means is going back to our roots as developers. Moving and manipulating data. That’s all we do. And there’s no shame in doing that! Businesses pay us a lot of money to move data back and forth!\nInstead of thinking about our programs as collections of objects, we should be thinking of them as data pipelines. Data flowing with steps transforming the data along the way.\nThis doesn’t only apply to code, by the way. It applies to architecture as well. Microservices are the extension of the object oriented principles to an architecture level. And here’s the real question, is all of the additional work and complexity really getting you anything? Or are you distributing your monolith and introducing network “stuff” as a potential hazard?\nSo, how do you start, imaginary other person in this conversation?\nWith simplicity.  Keep things unentangled.  If you're using an ORM and you're able to stop, do so.  Learn SQL, learn what's going on in the database underneath you.  Gain that knowledge and you'll know more than 75% of other developers [citation needed].  Re-examine the tools of your craft.  If you're using a framework because it's the only one you know, maybe it's time to branch out.  But whatever you do, write simply.  Take the time to understand a problem before you reach for a keyboard.  Only once you've understood the problem should you start writing.  And when you do, do the simplest thing you can to solve the problem.  Other developers (including future-you) will thank you.\nFor future listening...\nRich Hickey's Greatest Hits\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/drowning-in-a-sea-of-complexity/","title":"Drowning in a Sea of Complexity"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/etl-tracers/":{"body":"Firing visible data at a target to see if you hit\nETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipelines are notoriously complex and opaque.  I've always wanted something to pierce the opaqueness I've experienced on many ETL projects.  I'll take a wild guess I'm not the only one.  What follows is an idea I had around five years ago to pierce that opaqueness along with the experience I've had implementing it.\nIf you've watched any war or action movies, you've seen tracer rounds.  These are rounds designed to light up so that the person firing knows where their rounds are going downrange.  Typical rounds are invisible to the eye.  For more info, see wikipedia.  This is an idea that we can apply to ETL pipelines to give a sense of whether the invisible data is \"on target.\"\nWe can apply the same concept to give us visibility into the inter pipeline.  Using traditional monitoring solutions it's easy to see if services are up and running or the underlying box is struggling.  It's much harder to see whether the data flowing through is correct.\nWhy not make all records visible?\nNot all rounds in a given magazine are tracer rounds for a few reasons.  Tracer rounds are less lethal because they contain less mass than a standard round.  They're more complex (more expensive) to manufacture.  It's also not necessary.  From what little reading I've done, around every 5th round is a tracer round.  That's enough to give the gunner a sense of where they're shooting without the downsides of every round being a tracer.\nA similar effect happens with data packets (record, a batch of records, row, etc) in an ETL pipeline.  Logs/metrics have extra overhead, especially if you're emitting an entire data packet.  That overhead comes in the forms of network, processing, storage, and cognitive load when trying to interpret the results.  It's also not necessary as long as you have a representative sample of the data flowing through.  All we need to do is tag every n-th packet of data with a \"tracer\" flag and make sure all our code emits those tracers when they're seen.  Otherwise, process them as normal.\nZoom and Enhance!\nWhat if we could take the idea one step further?  If we emit data as it's already flowing through the pipeline, we have to do extra analysis when we examine those packets to determine if there are any errors in the pipeline, etc.\nInstead, if we hand-craft tracer packets it gives us absolute control over the content of the packet.  We can cover edge and corner cases and we know what the result should be at every step.  Think of this with the same mindset you craft unit tests.\nAlso, we can encode this information for every step in the pipeline.  The results of each of the extract, transform, and load steps should look very different from one another.  If we do this, then each step in the pipeline can emit a diff of what the output should be versus what it actually is.\nWait, this is just tests?!\nYep.  But it's testing you have the option of running in any environment (including production).  It's tests you can use in development if you want to throw a new data source into the pipeline.  It's regression tests that automatically tell you if you're now casting something to an int where it was a string before.  If you're running it in production, it can be a monitoring system for your ETL pipeline.  I.e., if you haven't seen tracers in n-minutes at the loader, either the transformer is having problems or the transport mechanism between the transformer and loader has failed.  It narrows down the number of places you need to check to look for failures.\nBenefits of Tracers\nIn my own implementation of the idea, we found that local development of new data sources was orders of magnitude faster.  In addition, we had regression tests we could run at a moment's notice to confirm that the 40+ data sources we were using hadn't broken because we fixed a bug with the 41st source.\nWe had several data sources change their format without telling us.  Using the tracer concept we were able to create a new tracer based on the new format and restore the source within a few hours.\nSo... how do I create a tracer?\nMy process is pretty simple.  I take a representative record from the source data and then hand-craft what I expect it to look like at the extract, transform, and load steps.  Like any good test I then take that representative record and change the input to explore the testing space.  Any good set of tests should hit happy paths, edge cases, corner cases, and known failure cases.  Tracers are no different.\nWhat are the components of a tracer?\nSource Data\nThis is as close as you can get to what the source data looks like.  Remember, this record is going to be flowing through your system like a regular record would.\nExtract/Transform/Load Expected Data\nThis is the expected output of each of these three stages.  Include only the ones you feel are necessary.  In my case, the transformer is the most critical step and as such, we crafted tracers around identifying transformer problems.\nExample Tracer\ntracer_happy_path:\n  input_record:  \"id,name,cost\\n1234,test name with single' quotes,1234.5\"\n  transform_output_record:\n    id: 1234\n    title_case_name: Test Name With Single' Quotes\n    float_price: 1234.50\n\nAwesomesauce, where can I get this code?\nThe idea isn't well-formed enough to turn into a library yet.  It requires the ETL pipeline know too much about the tracer implementation for the two concepts to decouple them at the moment.  I was, however, able to implement the idea in less than 200 lines of Python code for my particular case.\nLessons Learned in Implementation\n\nHand-crafting these data packets can be tedious and annoying.  They're hard to get right.\nYou need to drop tracer packets need to just before they'd end up in permanent storage.  I.e., if you're inserting into a relational database, run all the inserts/updates/etc, and then roll back the transaction.\nDepending on the language and implementation of this idea, the code needed to handle the tracers can add a lot of visual noise to the code.  Obviously, this is something that can be refactored and fixed, but it is a hazard.  In my case I used Python context managers and function decorators.\n\nKey Ideas\n\nTracers are intentionally crafted data packets that the ETL pipeline knows to emit a diff between expected and actual.\nTracers should flow through as much of the ETL pipeline machinery as possible including storage.\nTracers should either be ignored by downstream processes or they should be deleted/rolled back from storage.\nThink of tracers as constant end-to-end tests.  They should cover as many edge and corner cases as possible.\nTracers act as an early-warning system of deviated behavior, code regressions, data integrity issues.\nTracers act, as a side effect, as a monitoring system for the ETL pipeline (if you're not seeing tracers every n-minutes, something's wrong).\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/etl-tracers/","title":"ETL Tracers"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/first-responders-sign-language/":{"body":"A basic guide to the fundamentals of sign language likely to be needed for first reponders.\nBasic Communication\n\nYes\nNo\nStop\nPain\nEMT/Paramedic\nFire Fighter\nI don't understand\nCalm Down\nAre you hurt?\nMedicine\nDo you need help?\nWhat is wrong?\nAre you safe?\nFollow me\nAmbulance\nFire\nEmergency\nEvacuate\nHospital\nOxygen\nBreathe\nHeart\nBleeding\nAccident\n\nOrientation/Mental Status\n\nWhat's your name/who are you?\nWhere are you?\nWhat time/date/day is it?\n\nAssessment\n\nPoint to where it hurts?\nDrugs/Alcohol onboard?\n\nReferences\n\n24 ASL signs all first reponders should know\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/first-responders-sign-language/","title":"A First Responder's Guide to Sign Language"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/git-commit/":{"body":"\ngit commit -m \"gah!\"\n\nSo, apparently, git commit messages are a point of contention with developers.

The spectrum goes from startup through midsize and all the way up to massive-multinational-conglomerate. There are a few general rules of thumb I’ve come to recognize.\n\nAs size goes up, individual freedoms go down\nAs size goes up, stability and job security usually, but not always, increases\nAs size goes up, there’s a transition point from the focus on being right to the focus being on not being wrong\nAs size goes up, ping pong and foosball sessions are replaced with meetings\nAs size goes up, “unlimited” vacation is usually replaced with a vacation formula\nAs size goes up, unwritten rules get written down\nAs size goes up, uncertainty about perceived performance goes down\nAs size goes up, actual performance usually goes down\nAs size goes up, the on-boarding process gets longer and more detailed\n\nQuite a lot depends on where you want to live on this spectrum. Too much freedom and autonomy can be terrifying, especially if someone is more extrinsically motivated than intrinsically. On the other hand, too much bureaucracy can be stifling to motivation and productivity. As most things, it’s a balancing act. The real question is, where do you end up on that spectrum?\nAs I’ve gone through companies of drastically different sizes, I tend toward the high end of startup to the low end of midsize. Enough freedom to choose tools, languages, and projects, but enough guidance so I know I’m not going right off the rails.\nHaving policies and procedures written down is always helpful, at any size company, but I find that it’s the transition point from startup to midsize where most of the good documentation is generated. This seems to be where companies codify their culture. Some, of course, do it better than others but as a new-hire, there’s nothing more valuable than documentation to read and get a sense of what you just walked into.\nI also find that as size goes up, context provided tends to go up as well. Sometimes this is fantastic and other times, it’s overwhelming. When you’re trying to coordinate 20+ scrum teams using the “scaled agile framework” there’s too much context to hold in any one person’s head at any one point and communication breaks down. At the opposite end of the spectrum, there’s so little context for anything that you’re making it up as you go and hoping you’re going in the right direction.\nUnlimited vacation, for me, is actually more of a negative than a positive. In my experience it changes the equation from “I have this much time to take off, great!” to “how much political capital do I have built up to be able to take time out without unseen repercussions?” A much more difficult and complex question to answer.\nAs for stability, large companies generally don’t fold in a day. They do, however, lay off people, seemingly without much thought. So, while the company may not go under, your job may disappear. As many people have said, the idea that you can find a “forever company” at this point is mostly a myth. Maybe it’s possible, but it’s more likely that you’ll find a “good enough for now” company and when it no longer meets that criteria, you move on to the next one that fits that criteria.\nSize of company is objective, your experience of the best size for you is subjective. My advice is to find the right size and stick to it, even if you’re switching companies.

Why does it matter to me?  Wrapped up in that question is the context of why it matters to you, the creator.  Why you spent time producing the content.  Why is this a thing that needed to exist in the world?\nSometimes we may not understand that question ourselves, even while creating.  Something just needed to be there, period.  We happened to be the one that noticed it and had the skills to create it.  Great!  Once it's created, we can always go back in and take a second look, figure out why something is.  The best way I find to do this is to sleep on it, look at it with a fresh set of eyes, and come at it with the perspective of someone that doesn't know you, your motivations, your context, anything.\nTake, for example, this blog post.  Why does it need to exist?  It originally started out as a reaction to a \"vaguebook\" post I saw this morning, the very epitome of the lack of \"why\" (and a bunch of other things).  This lead me down a path of thinking through why I struggle to understand some people but not others.  Or, for that matter, why I can communicate with some people effortlessly but others it's like we talk past one another endlessly.  That's one \"why\" for me to write this post, but what do I hope a person reading it gets out of it?  The other side of the proverbial \"why\" coin.\nWhy should someone else read it? (\"someone else\" also being me, once I've lost the context and \"why\" of this post in the first place).  The most basic reason I can think of is to \"change the world.\"  Grandiose, I know, but stick with me.  We normally think of \"changing the world\" as being some grand thing.  What we, myself included, fail to recognize is that change can be so subtle, so slight, that no one even notices.  That's change too, just on a different scale.\nSo, back to my grandiose ideas of changing the world.  If one person, again myself included, reads this and because of it includes an answer to \"why\" in their next creation, then it's served its purpose.  Reducing the friction in communication between two beings.  Getting someone to share their perspective accurately with someone else.  That someone else being able to easily step into the perspective of the creator.\nSo, next time you create something, include a bit of \"why\".  No, you don't need to include 100 pages of backstory before you share your recipe for perfect boiled eggs, but I do want to understand at least a little of your perspective.  In this case, why your boiled eggs are better!\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/including-the-why/","title":"Including the Why"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/list-of-wonderous-links/":{"body":"This is going to be nothing more than a link post of articles and blogs that have resonated with me in a powerful way.

At that point, my father wouldn't buy or install games on the 286 we had, so I had to do it myself.\n\nFast forward about 20 years and I find my first job as a data analyst. Needing to automate some trivial tasks, I turn to VBScript. Looks like the same syntax I'm used to and, hey, look! I can do things!\nFrom there I learned SQL (specifically, Oracle flavored) and fell into a role as a sysadmin. Again, needing to automate things, I found Python. Que the angelic trumpets, harps, golden rays of light, etc. I can honestly say I've never been as productive as I am with python. For whatever reason, it clicks with my brain and whatever I conceive in my head just flows out into code. It's a beautiful thing (the code may not be, but the translation is effortless).\nSo one day, I'm having an issue with concurrency and Python (clearly, not one of it's strong points). I start googling for a better language for concurrency and I run into a fantastic blog post about Six Languages to Master (archive link). One of those languages is Clojure, well known to be fantastic for concurrency, it's also a Functional language which is a new paradigm for me.\nSix weeks later, I finally have the \"aha!\" moment with Clojure, the parentheses fall away, and I can see the matrix. Can't find a job programming in Clojure, but it's definitely made me a better Python programmer.\nA few months after that, and I find myself working for the best company I've ever worked for hands down. They ask me to learn PHP. \"Okay... this'll be easy, I learned Clojure for godsake!\"\nW.T.F. (periods for emphasis)\nSeriously? WTF?!\nOh, and while we're at it... OMGWTFBBQ?!\nWhat a \"language.\"\nWhile I won't extol its virtues or faults here, one thing I can say is:\n\"Web devs? My hat's off to you. You've managed to build some amazing websites, technologies, and make huge leaps forward. I just wish you didn't have to deal with such a mess of a language to do it.\"\nOf course, the obvious question is, what if you didn't have to deal with such a mess of a language (javascript doesn't count, it's almost as bad)? What things could you build if you didn't have to constantly fight the language, memorize what parts are case sensitive and which aren't, have to look up equality and truthiness every time you wanted to compare something?\nMaybe it's the complexity inherent in building a high-availability, concurrent, fault-tolerant system, but you would have thought that someone, at some point, would have come up with a better language that's at least as productive as PHP so you have one less thing to worry about!\nYou web devs need something better and I have NO idea what it might be.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/on-python-clojure-and-php/","title":"On Python, Clojure, and PHP"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard-part-2/":{"body":"tl;dr: if you're joining a company, your first n days shouldn't be spent being productive, they should be spent building knowledge and connections so you can be productive.\nAfter reading my last post, I've been stopping and starting the next one for close to a month.  The previous one focused pretty hard on what the hiring company can do to onboard a new hire.  Which is great and all, but that's only half of the story.  The other half is focusing on what the new hire can do to be onboarded as quickly and painlessly as possible.\nWith that being said, this is potentially more a note to me than to anyone else!\nCaveats\nFirst, I'm focusing on a technical/engineering onboarding, mostly because that's my background and what I have experience with.\nSecond, some of the advice may apply, some may not.  It all depends on the particular situation you find yourself in.  What works for one company or person may not work for the next.\nSocial\n\nIntroverts unite!  Separately!  In your own homes!\n\nJust a quick note, introversion/extroversion refers to how someone recharges their social energy.  Introverts tend to recharge alone, extroverts in the company of others.  Shy/outgoing refers to how comfortable someone is in a social situation.  In my experience, being shy tends to correlate with being introverted, but it's not always the case so YMMV.\nIf you're outgoing, fantastic!  You'll probably have an easier time integrating yourself into new company culture.  The only caution I would provide is to temper your enthusiasm just a little.  As a tech worker, you're probably interacting with more shy people than you are outgoing types.  More than anything though, just be your friendly communicative self and you'll be just fine.\nIf you're shy like I am, well, this is gonna be a little rough.  No real way to make it any better, it just is.  You know those really good friendships you (hopefully!) made at your last company, well, you can do the exact same thing here, but just like that last company, it's going to take some time.  Relationships, professional or not, are built over time via communicative trust.  What I mean by this is the reason why people start talking about the weather or the company is that it's a safe topic psychologically.  Can't just jump in and ask someone what they think about the universe and their place in it.  That's a much deeper topic that probes at the depths of the psyche and you need to build trust before you can have those sorts of conversations.\nSo, what do you do?  You reach out, maybe not in large groups as those awesome outgoing people can, but in small groups, within your team, maybe just one on one when you're asking questions.  Up your \"outgoingness\" just a tad and you'll be okay.  Don't get me wrong, it'll feel uncomfortable as hell, but you gotta do it and you'll be thankful that you did.  It'll turn an environment with a bunch of strangers into one where you just might hang out with the same people for 40+ hours every week.  If it helps, chances are the people on your team are just as shy as you are and are struggling just as much with meeting someone new.  If you make a little more effort than what's comfortable, you're easing their experience and you'll form work-friendships much faster.\nNow, to the introverts (extroverts, you already know what to do, go party!).  Whenever you start a new job, make sure you reach out to the people close to you in your life, whether that's your partner, your friends, your therapist, or your family.  Let them know what's going on and that you'll probably need a lot more time to recharge than you normally would, but that it's a temporary thing.  I guarantee they'll understand.  Everyone knows how stressful starting a new job can be and they'll support you.\nOne final caution, be yourself.  If you're pretending to be someone you're not, it'll only backfire in the end and you'll have a much harder time integrating with the culture.\nLunch/Happy Hour/Social Time\nI'll admit, it's very hard going out to lunch with a bunch of new people.  Usually, the restaurant is decently loud, it's hard to hear people, etc.  There are a few things you can do to make this easier.\nFirst off, the choice of the restaurant will probably be made for you.  If you have any dietary restrictions, make sure whoever is making the reservation/choice knows whether you can eat there!\nSecond, whenever you all go out for food, make sure to walk/ride with someone else.  It gives you a brief chance to have time with them beforehand and it'll also give you someone to sit next to that already has spent some time with you.\nThis next one is uncomfortable as hell, but put yourself in the middle as much as possible.  The point of this outing is for the team to meet you, ask questions, and for you to do the same.  This is much easier if you're sitting in the middle of the table where you can hear and be heard easily.  It also means that you're less likely to be sidelined out of conversations.\nIf you drink alcohol and people order it, feel free, but only order one.  After that switch to soda or water.  Why?  Sharing alcohol seems to help people form bonds quicker for whatever reason, but you don't want to go overboard.  Your goal here isn't to get drunk, it's to make connections.  If you don't drink, for whatever reason, order a non-alcoholic \"specialty\" drink.  Think a strawberry lemonade instead of water or soda.  Same reason.  Most people don't realize it doesn't have alcohol in it and pretty much everyone likes the fancy drinks, whether they want to admit it or not!\nFinally, try to ask open-ended questions.  These are questions that can't be answered with a single word answer.  They lead to a conversation instead of closing a conversation off.\n\nClosed question: \"How often do you guys do lunch here?\" -&gt; \"About every other week.\" (end of the conversation)\nOpen question: \"This is a great place, what other restaurants are good around here?\" -&gt; \"Wow, well, there's a, and b, and c.\" (which naturally leads to more questions and conversation).\n\nHeadphones/Tuning Out\nBelieve me, I love my Bose QC35's more than most.  It's sometimes the only way I can focus enough to debug code.  But, remember, your job while you're getting up to speed isn't to be productive, debug the hardest problem, or write the cool thing.  It's to gather enough knowledge and make personal relationships within the company so that you can do that.  Think of this as a sprinter stretching before a race.  If you don't stretch, limber up, warm up, you'll only hurt yourself.\nIf you do find yourself needing some focus time, make sure people know that you're still available.  In my case, that means keeping only one headphone on so I can listen to the office around me.  It gives the perception that I'm not in do-not-disturb mode.  Collaboration is easily more important than deep work in the early days at a company, and some would argue that it's always more important.  I'm not sure that I 100% agree with the last bit of that statement, but I wholeheartedly believe the first.\nYou'll also want to observe the people around you.  Do they spend most of their day collaborating, chatting, etc?  Or, do they spend their day grumpily downing coffee while jamming to psytrance?  Either way, it's very useful information as you acculturate into your new home.\nLearning the Tech\nThis is sometimes the easiest and sometimes the hardest part of coming up to speed at a new place.  Sometimes in the same hour!  Hopefully, you have a good understanding of the technology being used at your new company even if you may not understand how it's being implemented.\nKnow what's being used\nIn theory, this should be pretty easy.  The first time you got a taste of this information was in the job posting.  If they were looking for an Oracle DBA, there's a good chance they're using an Oracle Database.  Make a list of everything they were asking for and figure out why they were asking for that thing.\nOnce you've got that list, catalog all the primary technology choices you'll be working with on a daily basis.  Are there any you are weak on?  Great!  Focus on learning those every chance you get a free moment, which can be surprisingly often as a company tries to figure out how to use their new investment!  The advantage of doing this is you're making their investment seem more attractive every day.  You're showing initiative, and you're furthering your own knowledge.\nKnow how it's being used\nThis is the more important topic at hand.  How is it being used here?  The key to getting up to speed on this is usually understanding the history of how it got to now.  Not just the facts, but the reasons behind it.  Sometimes those reasons are very logical, sometimes it's \"because a guy that no longer works here did it that way\".  Either way, you know more than you did before.  If there are logical reasons for it, what assumptions were made that underpin the logic?  If it was rando-guy, can you tease out what assumptions he was making that lead him down that path?  Are they still valid?  Where are the pain points in the current system?  Needless to say, your first n days of spending time with the tech is going to generate a lot of questions.  Don't be afraid to ask the questions, write down the answers, and create documentation from that information.\nSeriously, that's the biggest way you can contribute in your first few days.  Writing documentation.  It may be imperfect or incomplete but it's probably more documentation than there was before, otherwise, you wouldn't have needed to ask the questions in the first place!  Plus, everyone loves it when someone writes documentation, as long as \"someone\" isn't them.  This is an easy way to get a quick win and learn something at the same time.\nDo a teach-back of the stack (or at least your portion of it)\nIf a meeting where you teach back to someone what you've learned about the stack, the technology, etc hasn't been scheduled, put one on the calendar.  Preferably with your team lead, manager, or someone who knows your area of the stack really well.  This is a fantastic chance to find the holes in your knowledge and get them filled right away.  It also reinforces the idea that you're a member of a team and not just a \"code in a cave\" stereotype.\nMake a PR\nPretty simple stuff, once you've pulled down the code, made a branch, and made your first commit, create a work-in-progress PR.  This instantly makes your work visible, which can be a very uncomfortable thing, but it also lets people point out issues with what you're writing that you may not have the knowledge to avoid.  This also lets you be humble about your knowledge.\nEssentially, this is all about shortening the feedback loop.  The shorter the feedback loop, the quicker you'll learn and the faster you'll be an effective contributor.  No matter how or what someone comments on your code, never take it personally, but especially in your first few months.  You are not your code.\nJoining On-call\nEven if your new company isn't going to have you join the on-call rotation, shadowing someone in your first few months can give you an idea of where the instabilities in the system are and where some of the pain points are.  This is invaluable knowledge as it gives you insight into where you can potentially make some nice wins.  While making wins shouldn't be a goal into and of itself, it's a great way to keep up your own confidence and start to show the company and your coworkers what a great person they picked!\nBefore you take your first on-call shift, reach out to your teammates and let them know that you'll try your best but you may need some help.  Gather who you should contact if you can't solve a problem and why/when/how to contact that person.  Sometimes you can leave an issue until the next day and pair with someone on it but that's not always clear from the incident notification.  The best thing you can do is try to triage it.  If it's truly a critical issue, wake people up.  At worst, it won't actually be a critical issue and there's a flaw in the documentation or notification that's found and corrected.  This makes everyone's lives better!\nWhen You're Stuck\nSo, you're stuck.  Do you ask for help or spend time researching/learning it yourself.  For me this really boils down to one question:\nIs this lack of knowledge something specific to the company or is it a lack of knowledge of something general?  I.e., can you google the answer?\nFor example, \"How does your build system kick off this Jenkins job?\" is a very different question than \"How do I configure Jenkins to push to an EC2 image?\"  The first one is specific to how the company has configured its build pipeline.  The second is more general.\nI'd spend a lot more time researching the general question than I would the specific one.  If I'm still not making any progress, then I'll start asking around to see if anyone's run into a similar issue.  I.e., if you can google the solution, you should probably at least try that first.\nClosing Thoughts\nNo one said meeting a bunch of new people, especially people that can impact your ability to have a job, was easy.  In fact, I'm saying it's the complete opposite.  It's damn hard.  But the thing is, it's worth it and the margin for error is pretty large.  You can screw up most of it and still be successful.\nSo, don't be too hard on yourself.  Present yourself as authentically as possible and you'll do just fine :)\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard-part-2/","title":"Onboarding Is Hard (part 2)"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard/":{"body":"Why both sides need to be positive, intentional, and communicative when someone new joins your company.\nWe've all experienced the first-day jitters and shininess that comes from the excitement of new possibility and challenge.  Broadly speaking, that energy can be focused one of two ways.  Either it's used to catapult the new employee onto the fast track of becoming an active contributor or it can precipitate a downward spiral into mediocrity, boredom, and ultimately quitting.  What follows here is my guide to capturing, focusing, and using that energy productively.\nHave a Plan\nSounds very simple I know, but you'd be surprised at how many places I've run into that thought they could just \"wing it\" when bringing someone new on.  This is can be predicated on a few potential assumptions.\n\nExisting documentation and/or team knowledge can be easily transferred to the new person.\nThe new person is a \"rockstar\" and will magically know what they don't know when they start, know where to get the information they don't have, and know enough to get their feet wet already.\n\nObviously, both of those are false assumptions but I've seen them play out time and time again.\nSo, your plan should look to fighting at least those two assumptions plus any others you can drum up from your particular culture, like, are there any unwritten rules?  Write that shit down!\n\nKnow where your existing documentation is, how it's organized, and where any major gaps are.  This should be an honest, factual assessment.  It isn't a value judgment.  This is something you can present to the new hire so they know where they're starting from.\nAssume that the new hire has knowledge of \"what\" but not \"how\".  What this means is if they say they know Python, great, but they don't know how your company/team/etc uses it in practice.\nFigure out the most likely questions they'll have and if you don't have the answers, no worries, compile a list of the most likely person to have the answer.  This can be a great way for a new hire to meet new people and start building working relationships.\n\n30/60/90 Goals\nIt's amazing to me how many places don't provide a new hire a \"roadmap\" for their first 3 months.  These are critical months in any new hire's journey that will set their trajectory for their time at your company.  This doesn't need to be a complicated map but it should include some of the following with examples given:\n\nTechnical goals\n\nThey should get a merge/pull request accepted in the first 2 weeks, and deployed to production in the first month.\nThey should shadow an on-call rotation by their 2nd month and feel comfortable taking on-call with a backup person by the end of their third month.\nIn their first month understand the overall architecture and do a \"teach-back\".\n\n\nSocial goals\n\nTake a person you've never met out to coffee every week.\nEvery month for your first three, pick a different C-level executive to add into the coffee rotation.\nConversations can be business focused or not.\nThe goal is to make a human connection with the people you're likely to spend at least 40 hours per week.\n\n\nCareer growth goals\n\nIn your first month, determine whether your current team fits where you want to be.\nIn your second month, determine where you want to go in the company in terms of career.\nBy your third month have a plan for how to get there and present it to your manager.\n\n\n\nBuddy System\nFor fuck's sake, assign any new hire a buddy they can go to with any question they may have without any judgment.  This should be the first person they have coffee with and the first person they go to with \"dumb\" questions.  These questions can range from \"where's the 2nd bathroom if the primary one is full\" to \"where does this piece of code live\" to \"who do I ask about pushing code to production\" or even \"how does time-off work in practice and who do I ask for it\".  Think of this as a built-in acculturator and work-friend.\nNote, that if this is the new hire's default work-friend, it's best to see if you can tease out who'd be a good match for them.  Or, at the very least, don't pick your grumpiest engineer to play the hand-holding role.\nAcculturation\n\nassimilation to a different culture, typically the dominant one.\n\nEvery company has its own culture.  Some are similar enough to others that it's like putting on a different shirt.  Others are similar but they have weird buttons, on the wrong sides, and collars, and what's this pocket doing here?!\n\"Close\" and \"same\" are two very different things.  You can think of culture as some of the written and unwritten rules of \"how we work together\".  The same work still needs to get done, code needs to be written, reviews need to be done, etc.  How that happens is different in every company, even if they use the exact same tools.  Perfect example, one company I was with just threw pull requests into the #engineering slack channel with an @here attached.  My first week at another company I did the same thing and was privately scolded for using @here.\nProbably one of the biggest acculturation topics is communication.  How the company communicates, what different tools are used for, even what different chat channels are used for can be a huge help.\nCommunication\nThis is probably one of the biggest ones, at least for me.  Helping your new hire understand how their new company communicates.  This can either be a huge stumbling block or it can be their ticket to acculturating in a week.  Communication is probably one of the easiest ways to inadvertently step on toes, especially in any sort of textual communication (email, slack, etc).\n\nWhat methods of communication are acceptable?\nWhat are those various methods used for day-to-day?\nWhat's the expectation and acceptability of off-hours communication?\nWhat's the quickest way to irritate someone from a cultural point of view?  (and how to avoid it yet communicate the same thing)\n\nWhat's the Point?\nSo, what's the point here?  Onboarding is hard, damn hard.  Let's not make it harder than it has to be.  Remember, the hiring of someone new is very expensive and you should put just as much effort into the post-hire as you do the pre-hire.  Always look at it from the perspective of the new hire.  Give them the hand up they need to get their feet under them and they'll become a productive member of your team faster with more smiles on either side.\nThe alternative is to let them flail as some sort of weird hazing ritual and see if they succeed.  They might, yes, but you'll have wasted a lot of time, money, and effort needlessly.  With the ultimate downside that they'll likely quit much sooner than they would have otherwise.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard/","title":"Onboarding Is Hard"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/pages/":{"body":"","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/pages/","title":""},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/predict-the-future-of-your-industry/":{"body":"Honestly?

I'm probably full of shit about this but we'll see.\nWriting every day.  I'm doing relatively well on this so far.  Not necessarily writing every day, but writing on a regular basis.  Publishing what I've written to my blog as long as it's not too personal.  So far, so good.  Don't want to jinx it though!\n\nSo, what projects are you working on?  What projects are floating around in your head that you haven't gotten started?  What projects could you be working on if only you had time/energy/money/motivation/etc?\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/projects/","title":"Projects"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/python-to-scala/":{"body":"Let me set the background.  I'm not a classically trained programmer.  In fact, I've been coding for about 8 years and ended up teaching myself on the job.  I'm currently a senior software engineer and end up fighting with Imposter Syndrome on a regular basis.\nI've been a Python programmer for pretty much that entire time with occasional dabbles in other languages (Clojure, Java, Scala, Node, etc).  In my current (new) position, I'm working in a Scala codebase.  A language that I've never had to put the effort forward to learn.  Three days in and I totally had a lightbulb moment:\nScala is Typed Python on the JVM with Braces\nTake for instance the Person class in Python:\nclass Person(name, age):\n    def description:\n      return \"{} is {} years old\".format(name, age)\n\nand the same thing in Scala:\nclass Person(val name: String, val age: Int) {\n    def description = name + \" is \" + age + \" years old\"\n}\n\nI mean, yeah, there's a ton of other stuff in Scala (it's a batteries-included language like Python) but the more I look at it the more I see how similar they are instead of how different they are.  Scala has an advantage that functional programming concepts are much more accepted in terms of style than they are in Python.\nScala also has things like for-comprehensions (list comprehensions).\nPython:\nl = [i for i in range(100) if i % 2 == 0]\n\nScala:\nval l = for (i &lt;- 0 to 100 if i % 2 == 0) yield i\n\nSo far, it's not as difficult a mountain to climb as I expected and that's a very good thing!\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/python-to-scala/","title":"Python to Scala"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading-update/":{"body":"So, after about 8 months of on-and-off focusing on reading more long-form items, how am I doing?  Objectively, I'd give myself a C-.  Barely passing, and here's why.\nI can absolutely say that I'm doing much better at reading long-form items.  Currently I'm working through Stephen Hawking's Illustrated A Brief History of Time and The Universe in a Nutshell.  Fantastic read, really engaging, and it's great to be able to relax with a book before bed.\nThat being said, I haven't been doing as well at actually finishing long-form books.  I have at least 3-4 books going on my Kindle right now with almost no motivation to finish them.  I can't quite say why, though I wish I knew.  I think part of it is dealing with some pretty serious depression lately and that, of course, seems to drown any motivation to do much of anything.\nSo, plan going forward?  Make time (at least 30 minutes a day) to read something on the Kindle.  Mornings may actually be the best time for this as I normally screw around on my phone for at least that much time before leaving for work.  Discipline, right?\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading-update/","title":"Reading Update"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading/":{"body":"So, reading. It's something I grew up loving. I used to spend every waking moment with my head stuck in a book. Everything from software development to high fantasy to memoirs. This began when I was very young, my parents used to read to me every night before bed and my dad promised me that whenever we went to a bookstore, he'd buy me whatever I wanted to read as long as I kept reading. Of course, at that time, it seemed like he'd just given me the keys to the candy store and he pretty much did.\nFrom then on, I was a \"reader\". It always amazed me when I talked to someone that didn't read. I always thought in my head that they must have a very boring life and I was always very close to labeling them \"stupid\".\nAll that changed a few years ago and, to be honest, I'm still not sure what really happened. I feel like it started around the same time I got a smartphone. Now I could read short blogs, tweets, page-long articles, wherever I wanted for free. Fast forward a couple of years and I still buy paper books but I don't read them as often. I've gone from reading books several hours every day to reading maybe once a week for an hour if I'm lucky.\nI hate it.\nI hate the fact that I'd rather look at a screen than feel the pages of a book in my hand, smell the paper and ink, visit old friends between those pages.\nI hate that I've gone from being a \"reader\" to being a \"dumb\" smartphone user. To becoming one of the people that I couldn't understand when I was younger.\nI hate it and I'm going to change it.\nI'm not sure what that looks like. I've been seriously considering a kindle paperwhite lately. Mostly because it feels like a bridge back to reading what I used to love, books. On my phone I primarily read blogs, hacker news, facebook, twitter, very short form things and I've found over the past year or so that I'm almost unable to keep my attention focused on anything longer. At least with a kindle I can switch between stories as I'm reading and \"stretch\" my attention span back out.\nIt's difficult to extend my own personal experience to the general population at large, but I do feel that children and adults both have shorter attention spans. Both due to the massive amount of information we're expected to consume and retain on a daily basis and to the massive amount of information we CAN consume at a moment's notice.\nWill my experiment to change myself work? I guess we'll see in a few months.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading/","title":"Reading"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/refactoring-python-if-statements/":{"body":"Note: I'm not recommending the following refactoring to everyone, nor am I saying it was even a good idea.

I've also done my best to anonymize it so to protect the guilty.\nThe White Whale\nStory time!\nI ran into this block of code my 3rd or 4th day on the job and recoiled in horror at it.  At the same time, it fascinated me that this was the encoding of some admittedly convoluted but mission-critical business logic into Python.  The \"standard\" refactor for an if-elif-elif-elif block in Python is to reach for a dictionary (hashmap for those not familiar with Python), encode the predicates into the keys and the functions to be called in the values.\nGreat... but... does that mean we need a nested dictionary here and, more importantly, would that actually make the code more readable?\n# we start with the first \"layer\":\n{'first': {}\n 'second': {}}\n\n# cool, that was easy... now the second \"layer\":\n{'first': {pred_2: {}\n           pred_3: {}\n           }}\n\n#uhhhh... we're going off the rails here...\n\nThe problem here comes down to the different layers not being symmetrical.  They all have various conditions and an amalgamation of predicates, states, and even types (some are lists, others are enums, others are booleans).\nSo... un-refactorable?\nI'll be honest, at this point I was wondering if it really was un-refactorable.\nThe One That Got Away\nI left the code as-is for quite some time.  Months actually.  It was always sitting in the back of my head though, like an itch you can't quite scratch.  Refactoring this bit of code was always on my to-do list, but I could never seem to find the time to really think about it.  Add on to this, it was mission-critical business logic encoding.  That always carries an inherent risk when you're refactoring.  There were tests around the code, but they ended up having major holes.\nA Light on the Horizon\nTests...\nThe golden rule of refactoring is that you never do it without a good set of tests to verify old and new logic.\nHah!  Of course!  Write unit tests around the entire if-statement-of-crazy.  If nothing else, I figured this would give me a deeper understanding of the business logic and the all-crucial \"why\" to some of the crazy logic.  While I was doing this, I sat down with a number of my coworkers to fill in the gaps in my knowledge.  As always, ask the people that were there first!\nDarkness\nWhile I was chatting and interviewing my coworkers about this bit of code, there was an ominous phrase that kept popping up...\n\nThis isn't the first time someone's tried to refactor that if statement.\n\n...great...\nAfter some introspection and some poking and prodding at my ego, I finally decided that it'd make a fun side project to try.  If I didn't succeed, no worries, at least I had added a ton of tests around it so the next time it needed to change, we could be safe about changing it!\nThe Hunt\nAfter a number of false starts, thrown out code, and late nights I hit upon an interesting idea.\nTo look up a key in a Python dictionary, the get method does two things.  First, it hashes the key you're looking up and compares it with all the hashed keys in the dictionary.  The second thing it does an equality comparison of the unhashed lookup key and unhashed dictionary key.  I assume the second round is to prevent hash collisions, but I honestly don't know.\nAt the same time, I was looking into using namedtuples as a way to encode multiple values into the key.  They have the advantage of being immutable and have easy methods to get and set values (important for readability of the final code).\nShot and a Miss\nThat was my next thought, encode all the logic into a namedtuple \"template\" and compare the actual data against the keys in the dictionary.\nWell, there's a problem with that.  At runtime, we don't always have all the data necessary for a given branch of the codebase and, in fact, some of the data may be set, but it may not matter.\nThe upshot of this is that some branches of the if statement have an importance priority of the data looked up that's different than other branches.\nA New Drawing Board\nSo, again, I was stumped.  If you compare two namedtuples with one another, all the data has to match or they aren't considered equal.  Even if I could solve that problem, there was still the problem of the hash lookup in the dictionary.  If two namedtuples don't have the exact same data in them, their hashes won't match and thus looking it up in a dictionary will always fail.\nDigging into Python's hash magic methods, I hit upon a simple idea.  Make all the hashes the same.  That way Python is forced to use the equality function on the namedtuples when it compares them against the dictionary keys.\nA New Hope\nThankfully everything in Python has public visibility.  The upshot of this is it means that I can create my own custom namedtuple that provides all the benefits of immutability as well as the readability of the fields, along with a custom equality function.\nWhat this all boils down to is this bit of code for creating the Template for the dictionary.  These are meant to be filled with data and used as the keys in the lookup dictionary.  In addition, this namedtuple is used to fill out the data to be compared against the keys in the dictionary.\n# Decision matrix used in determining which data process to kick off\nTemplate = namedtuple(\"Template\", ['pred1', 'pred2', 'pred3', 'pred4', 'pred5', 'pred6', 'pred7'])\n# Default any non-filled out fields to None\nTemplate.__new__.__defaults__ = (None,) * len(Template._fields)\n# Disable the hash function\nTemplate.__hash__ = lambda self: 1\n# Set our custom equality function\nTemplate.__eq__ = rd_eq\n\nCustom Equality\n\"Custom Equality\" is such a great term, and it really threw the more science-minded folks for a loop!\nTo ease their trepidation, I told them that I wasn't really setting up a custom equality, I was making sure that it works as a template rather than an exact match.  If data shows up in the template, it's important, if it doesn't, then it's not and can be anything.\nNote that the bottom code is more complex than just a simple template.  If you notice in the original code, there's a lot of if x in ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] thrown around along with at least one if ['a', 'b'] == ['a', 'b', 'c'] style.  That makes comparing against a template messy.\ndef rd_eq(template, other):\n    \"\"\"Compare fields in template to fields in other if template.field is not None\n    template and other are expected to be namedtuples, tuples, or lists.\n    Order of the elements in each *does* matter.\n    If an element is a list, make sure that all the subelements of that list appear in the template.\n    :param template: namedtuple, non-null values are used for comparison\n    :param other: namedtuple, all/some/none values can be filled out and will be compared with non-null values from template\n    :return: true if the non-null values in template \"match\" in other, false otherwise\n    \"\"\"\n    # compare template type to other type\n    if template.__class__ != other.__class__ or len(template) != len(other):\n        return False\n    for template_val, other_val in zip(template, other):\n        if template_val is not None:  # only \"filled out\" template values matter\n            # compare element types\n            if isinstance(template_val, list):\n                if isinstance(other_val, list):\n                    # if all the values in the \"template\" don't exist in the \"other\", return false\n                    if len(set(template_val).intersection(set(other_val))) != len(set(template_val)):\n                        return False\n                else:\n                    if other_val not in template_val:\n                        return False\n            elif template_val != other_val:\n                return False\n    return True\n\nIt's worth reading through a few times, but in a nutshell:\n\nIf the value of a field in the template is filled in, try to compare it\nIf the value of the field is a list and the value being compared against isn't, make sure the value being compared against is in the list.\nIf the value of the field is a list and the value being compared against is also a list, make sure the values in the template exist in the value being compared against.\n\nThe Final Frontier\nThe last step in the crazy mess is to get our custom dictionary up and running.\nFirst, we set up the list of templates in order from most-restrictive to least.\n# Just a coupling of data function and basic log message to send\nFnRunner = namedtuple(\"FnData\", ['fn', 'log_message'])\n\ndecisions = [\n    (Template(pred2=['val1']),\n     FnRunner(fn=self.process_data_2, log_message='Running data process 2')),\n    (Template(pred1='first',\n              pred3=[state_management_2.state1, state_management_2.state3, state_management_2.state4],\n                    pred4=True),\n     FnRunner(fn=self.process_data_1, log_message='Running data process 1'))\n# &lt;snip&gt;\n]\n\nThen we shove it in an ordered dictionary to preserve the restrictiveness (fun fact, ordered dictionaries are compared in-order)\nself.decision_tree = OrderedDict(decisions)\n\nFrom there, we get the data to compare against and shove it into a Template namedtuple and fire off the comparison:\n# get the realtime data to compare against the templates\nrunner_data = Template(get_decision_data())\n\n# create a noop function if we don't find a lookup in self.decision_tree\nrunner_noop = FnRunner(fn=lambda *args, **kwargs: RunnerResults(),\n                       log_message=\"Nothing to do, ignoring\")\n\n# lookup the correct data runner function to run\n# this is where the equality is called and everything is bashed against one another\ndata_runner_fn = self.decision_tree.get(runner_data, runner_noop)\n\n# finally, run the function we found\noutput_data, log_message = data_runner_fn()\n\nConclusion\nOnce I was done with all of this crazyness and had a working prototype that passed at least some of the tests I bounced it off of the team.  Their reactions were a pretty mixed bag, everything from disbelief that I had actually refactored the if-statement-of-crazy to curiosity at how I had done it.\nTo be honest, I'm still not 100% satisfied with the result, but the feedback in the following weeks was nothing but positive.  This is telling because around the same time, the business logic now encoded in the dictionary changed drastically.  This change was estimated to take around 2-4 weeks in the old if statement.  In the new one, it was done in 2 days.\nI think the increase in productivity speaks for itself.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/refactoring-python-if-statements/","title":"Refactoring Python if Statements"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/":{"body":"TFC Learning Plan\n\nTeaching\nVehicle Recovery\nVehicle Repair\nDriving\nMisc Knowledge\n\nWinch Line\n\nWire Rope\nSynthetic\n\n\n\n\n\nPages &amp; Posts\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/","title":"Test for Certification (TFC)"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/adult-education/":{"body":"Adult Education\nNotes from Previous TFC\n\nwant/need\n\ninvoke peer pressure\nteam, family, children\n\n\nsolving problems\n\nconstructionist (build puzzle)\ndestructionist (removing things)\ncause &amp; effect\n\n\ninstruction\n\nlist of steps\nrecipe\n\n\neducation \n\nenabling problem solving\nget people to think\nwhat gaps need to be filled\nproviding knowledge\n\n\ntraining\n\nrepetition\n\n\nexperience\n\nanchoring effect\nmake a connection\n\n\nfeedback\n\nbecomes a conversation\n\n\nproblem students\n\nbe humble\nbe a human being\nallow connection\ngroup dynamics\n\n\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/adult-education/","title":"Adult Education"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/bolt-grades/":{"body":"Bolt Grades\nCommon Grades\nGrade 5 (8.8) 1/4\" - 1\"\n\nIdentification\n\n3 hash marks 120 degrees apart\nGrey/Silver in color\nBreaks suddenly\n\n\nStrength\n\nProof Load: 85,000psi\nTensile: 120,000psi\nYield: 92,000psi\nShear: 72,000psi (~60% of Tensile)\n\n\n\nGrade 8 (10.9)\n\nIdentification\n\n6 hash marks, one for each side of the bolt\nBronze/Gold in color\nYields before breaking\n\n\nStrength\n\nProof Load: 120,000psi\nTensile: 150,000psi\nYield: 130,000psi\nShear: 90,000psi (~60% of Tensile)\n\n\n\nGrade 9 (~12.9)\n\nIdentification\n\n9 hash marks\n\n\nStrength\n\nProof Load: 145,000psi\nTensile: 180,000psi\nYield: 155,000psi\nShear: 108,000psi (~60% of Tensile)\n\n\n\nDefinitions:\n\nTensile Strength: The resistance of a material to breaking under tension\nYield Strength: The stress at which a specific amount of deformation is produced\nProof Load: An axial tensile load which the product must stand without evidence of any permanent set.\n\nSources:\n\nBolt Grade Markings &amp; Strength Chart\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/bolt-grades/","title":"Bolt Grades"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/hilift/":{"body":"Hi-Lift Jack\nParts\n\n\n1.

A large part of that job is learning about what others have done and then implementing that to make things better.\nExploration\nOr, huh, that sounds interesting, let's go exploring!\nIn essence, this is the flip side of curiosity. Instead of learning someone else's tech, go build something new. A great reminder for this is to have a 'whizbang' project folder on every computer you control. It's a gentle nudge to always be thinking about the really hard problems. This concept came from Jeff Knupp's awesome blog:\nWhizbang Project Post\nFearlessness\nOr, break stuff!\nGet your hands dirty! Is it a technology you don't understand, can't wrap your brain around? Who cares! Go play with it, get it installed, get a hello world working, and then go nuts. It's one of the best ways to internalize how a given technology can work (or not!) for you. As long as you're not driving your local sysadmin nuts with breaking hardware, you should be good.\nAll of this boils down to having an entrepreneurial mindset as it relates to pushing tech forward into the future. If you're not learning, pushing things forward, making stuff better, then the question you need to be asking is whether you're stagnating. If you're stagnating it makes it very easy to replace you unless you've built walls of code around your position that only you understand. And that, very quickly, turns you into a curmudgeon (or a BOFH).\nDon't be a curmudgeon, no one likes 'em and I've never seen one that was actually happy.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/the-most-important-skills-for-a-software-developer/","title":"The Most Important Skills for a Software Developer"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tools-i-work-with/":{"body":"Yay for interesting writing prompts. Here’s a quick list of the tools I use on a daily basis to get my job as a software engineer done:\n\nSlack: pretty much required for asynchronous communication. Email is reserved primarily for more “formal” communication over “getting shit done”.\niTerm2: terminal emulator, nothing much to say here but it’s far and away the best on OSX, to the point where I can ignore it. I love tools that get enough out of my way that I can ignore that they are even a thing!\nFish: friendly interactive shell. For now, my shell of choice over bash and zsh. It works better out of the box but unfortunately isn’t bash-compatible. I waffle between fish and zsh on a regular basis but have been sticking with fish for close to a year now. Probably means it’s time to go back to zsh and oh-my-zsh\nSpacemacs (with vim bindings via evil-mode): definitely a powerful editor/ide/etc. Has the most fully-functional Scala integration outside of intelliJ (which I won’t use on principal). The spacemacs configuration lends itself to discoverability as well as a pretty low-friction setup (for non-emacs users like myself). The vim bindings are the best modal editing I’ve found and are in most editors so I’m able to turn them on and just “get to work” faster. I’m definitely not a vim wizard by any stretch but I do find the editing capabilities much better than any other key bindings I’ve found yet.\nVisual Studio Code: for when spacemacs freaks out and won’t work or if I’m writing Rust (spacemacs rust stuff… kinda-sorta works well enough if you’re familiar with the language, which I’m really not). Also, if I just need a change of pace.\nChrome: for the longest time I used Chrome for password management so it was my default, but I’m considering moving to Firefox now that I’m using 1password as my password manager on all my devices.\nnvAlt: notational velocity. I have it bound to cmd+` and love its ability to pop up and pop away, support for markdown, and the ability to sync (or not) with various platforms based on where you save its files. The stupid-fast-searching is well worth taking a look at.\nInsomnia: a postman clone that, IMO, is cleaner and more intuitive. Plus, I just like being different.\nGitKraken: hands down the best GUI Git interface. Integrates well with both Github and Gitlab, very performant. Multi-platform. For me, it removed the fear when doing a rebase because I knew exactly what I was doing when and where. I do, however, tend to use spacemacs git integration layer for simple commits.\n\nThat pretty much wraps it up for tools. Those are the primary ones I use in my day-to-day writing Scala and Rust. Of course, it’ll probably change over the next few months as I get bored pretty easily and when a new shiny comes along, I can’t resist giving it a try!\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tools-i-work-with/","title":"Tools I Work With"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/uses/":{"body":"Uses\nA succinct overview of tools I use on a regular basis, mostly focused on my day job of software developement but possibly other random stuff thrown in.\nSoftware\n\nEmacs (Doom) https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs\nFirefox\nDevUtils\nVSCode\nSlack\niTerm2\nzsh\nStarship\nGitKraken\nAmethyst\nFinda\nSyncthing: Dropbox kinda-sorta replacement\nBlurred\nQuicksilver\nHexo\n\nServices\n\nProtonMail: Personal email\nYouNeedABudget: Finance tracking\nDeezer: Music\nGithub: Off-computer code backup\nGitlab: Off-computer code backup, blog\nKagi: Search engine\nDropbox\n1Password\nFeedly\nxBrowserSync\nA Fine Start: pseudo-bookmarks on your new tab screen\n\nHardware\n\nMacBook Pro (i.e., whatever work provides me)\nUltimate Hacking Keyboard https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/\nRemarkable2\nPixel 6 Pro\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/uses/","title":"Tools I Use"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/vacation-is-hard/":{"body":"...not necessarily because going on vacation is hard, but coming back from it? Oof.\nI just spent 10 days camping without cell phone service at a spiritual retreat. Had a great time, hung out with friends that I only see once a year, and had some seriously knock-your-socks-off spiritual moments.\nThen, the return to day-to-day \"normalcy\". Usually it takes me a few hours, maybe a day at most to get back into the swing of things. For whatever reason this time? It's already a week and I'm still not back. And, when I say \"I'm not back\" what I mean is that my brain isn't working in normal mode yet. Here, let me give you an example.\nWhen camping for 10 days with 200+ of your closest friends it's \"normal\" to have a 10'x10' popup structure for your kitchen, a 10'x20' carport for your living room, and have an 8 person tent for 2 people. This, of course, presents challenges. Things such as \"how do I keep water from dripping down between the kitchen and the living room\".\nThe context switch between solving such physical, tangible, see-results-immediately problems and solving \"how do I connect to this database through a ssh tunnel again?\" is so massive I don't have words to describe it and I haven't been this tired in a long time. I've tried \"easing\" back into it and that failed pretty miserably when I couldn't remember half my passwords which immediately threw me into option 2 \"jumping into the deep end\" which also failed miserably.\nWhat I can't get out of my head is what an amazing time I had camping and how much I wish I was right back up there. It's a calling on a deeply personal, spiritual level. Maybe the only answer is to try to rebuild that same experience here back in the \"real world\".\nWish me luck...\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/vacation-is-hard/","title":"Vacation is Hard"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/when-it-s-time-to-move-on/":{"body":"I'm now in the final stages of moving from my current company to a new one.  What follows is a rundown of what's been going on in my brain throughout the entire process, my motivations, and my reasoning.\nThis is not intended to disparage my current company nor hold the new company up on a pedestal.  This is my (limited) perspective.\nComing to Conclusions\nHindsight is, of course, 20:20.  Every time I've left a job, I've been able to see where the thought of leaving started, why it kept brewing for so long, what I did or didn't do to perpetuate the thought, etc.  With each new job, I'm unable to see that moment when it actually happens, or for that matter, I can't seem to see the lead-up to that moment.\nWhy am I feeling like leaving?\nI can cite many reasons for leaving at this point, but what it comes to is two points.  I'll dive into these in a moment.\n\nI'm feeling bored and have been for some time\n&nbsp;* Bored People Quit\nI feel like management ignores my voice and perspective\n\nBored?\nTalk about a first-world problem, right?\n\n\"I'm booooreddddddd, somebody give me something interesting to dooooooooo\"\n\nIt's not as trite and silly as it sounds though.  If you haven't read the above link, stop reading this and go read Bored People Quit now otherwise what I'm going to say going forward won't make much sense.\nAt my current position, I ended up getting hit in the crosshairs of two separate \"boredom\" concepts that Rands talks about:\n\nKeeping an interesting problem squarely in front of them.\n\n\nThey can only ‘take one for the team’ for so long.\n\nSomewhat related to one another, my position ended up being prod support for an unnecessarily complex and complected piece of software.  While I understood the reason behind my \"taking one for the team\" (I actually volunteered for it because I was the logical choice given domain knowledge, skill set, etc), it extended far longer than I expected and far longer than I was able to be intrinsically motivated.  Prod support isn't terribly interesting and this exacerbated the situation.\nI should have realized that I was getting \"bored\" much sooner than I did and I take full responsibility for that.\nWhen I realized what was going on and started speaking up... well...\nIs anyone truly listening?\nIn short, I felt like no one was hearing my concerns.  I was speaking out primarily in one-on-one meetings, but occasionally in larger meetings, \"hey, we need to stop band-aiding this issue and actually fix it.\"\nAs a shy introvert, I tend to not speak up a lot.  This leads to my team lead or manager putting on literally every review \"needs to speak up more\".  Same thing I've heard since elementary school.  Sorry people, I'm not wired that way.  If I'm talking, chances are I have something important to say.  Unfortunately volume, in both loudness as well as amount, is valued over content.\nThis historically has led me into a downward spiral of \"no one's listening to me anyway, why should I speak up?!\"\nWhat am I looking for?\nThis was a critical question for me to answer.  Was I looking for \"different\" or was I actually looking for something \"better\"?\nThose look different from one another and I decided that I was looking for \"better\".  This led me to turn down interviews and severely limited which companies I was applying to.  Where I work is a good place to work so finding \"better\" ended up being an interesting challenge.  I was done with the current company by this point and my intrinsic motivation had shifted from \"working on something interesting\" to \"finding something interesting to work on\".\nLooking Elsewhere\nResumes and interviews are a game of numbers.  With that in mind, the best advice I can give is to spread your resume as far and wide as you possibly can.  My offer came through a new-to-me website called Hired.com which I was very happy with.  It took me a couple of tries to get responses from companies but I had two solid interview experiences and almost nothing by applying directly.  I estimate that I probably sent out my resume to 20-30 companies.\nOut of that pool, I got a grand total of 4 phone screens, which led to 3 2nd phone screens, and 1 on-site.\nLike I said, it's a game of numbers.\nDifferent vs. Better\nThe Final Decision\n\nHow does it feel to leave the best company you've ever worked for?\n\nLeave it to one of my best work buddies to ask the hard questions.  What it feels like to me is I'm not leaving the best company I've ever worked for.  I'm leaving a company.  That's it.  When I first started, it was the best company I'd ever worked for but over time, that transformed into \"just another job.\"  Once it hit that point, it was no longer the best company I'd ever worked for.\nThe Fallout\nEmotions Run High\nIt's important that once you make an announcement you let any feedback roll off your back.  Coworkers will feel betrayed, happy, angry, panicked.  The whole gamut of emotions, sometimes in rapid succession, sometimes all at once.  It's rough, both for them and you, so give them the benefit of the doubt.\nWho is this person anyway?!\nYou find out interesting things about people when you \"betray\" them by leaving.  Remember, leaving a company is like going through a breakup.  You're essentially telling them and the company that they aren't good enough.  Try to let them down easy but don't patronise them either.  And for insert-deity-here's sake, help through the transition.  You're already holding a blow torch to a gas-soaked bridge by leaving.  Do your best to not light the bridge!\nTime Off\nAlways, always, always, make sure to take at least a week off between companies, longer if possible.  Take that time to reset, clear your head, and drop any baggage you were carrying from your former employer.  It's not fair to the new company, your new coworkers, or yourself to carry that pile of crap with you into the new job.\nFreshness\nOnce you've (hopefully) taken that time off, walk into the new company with fresh eyes.  Your first months at a new company are the most valuable, in my opinion.  You have the perspective of looking at the code, infrastructure, policies and procedures, etc with an outsider's perspective.  That perspective doesn't last long so at the very least take notes and ask the dumb questions.  Those questions that seem simple on the surface but question the status-quo.  That's not to say you should expect anything other than \"that's the way things are and we can't change it.\"\nThat being said, you might just spur a vastly positive change for the company.  At worst, you learn a ton about the history of the company and how they got to \"now\" which can only make you more effective at your new job.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/when-it-s-time-to-move-on/","title":"When It's Time to Move On"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/why-i-love-rpg-s/":{"body":"Introduction\nFor the people that know me, they know I love RPG's, whether they be computer based, tabletop, or just reading the new source book that came out yesterday.  Maybe it seems a bit odd to the general population with questions like \"isn't that dangerous/satanic?\"  Seriously, this still gets asked 30+ years after D&amp;D (Dungeons &amp; Dragons) was put in the same category as fictional satanic cults.  But I digress.  In this post I hope to answer the \"why\" of RPG's for me and maybe encourage you to take a look at them as well.\nWhat is an RPG?\nAnyone that's played an RPG can feel free to skip over this section.  I'm including it for anyone that has no clue what I'm talking about.  For the most part I'm going to be focusing on tabletop/in-person RPG's, not the computer variety.\nIn a nutshell, you can think of an RPG as 3-6 friends, sitting around a table for a few hours, telling a story together.  That's it, the rolling of dice, rules, character sheets, etc is all ancillary to the telling of a good story together.\nRPG stands for Role Playing Game.  What that means is you take on the persona (or role) of a character in a story.  In most games, there are 2 primary roles: the Player Character (PC), and the Game Master (GM).  In some games the GM is called the Dungeon Master (DM) but for the most part they are interchangeable terms.\nThe GM plays the part of the world.  I.e., they tell the PC's what they see, set difficulties to determine whether PC's succeed or fail at a given task, act out the part of any Non-Player Characters (NPC's), and just generally run the game.  They, in most games, also spend quite a bit of time outside of the actual game session thinking up and researching the \"bones\" of the story and the setting.\nThe PC's act out the part of their characters in the game.  They take on the persona of a character and generally explore, fight, and experience the setting and story.\nNormally players meet in-person or in an on-line voice/video chat on a regular basis for sessions.  A session can be thought of as a chapter in a book or the amount you would read in one sitting.  It can last anywhere from a few minutes to upwards of an entire weekend.  In my own experience, everyone generally starts getting tired and burned out after about three hours or so.  In a general sense a session is the telling of a part of the story by the GM and PC's, resolving of challenges/battles, and gathering rewards to further character development.\nWhy I find RPG's interesting\nThere are a number of reasons why I find RPG's so interesting.  The first of which is you're telling a story with friends that has never been heard before.  Even if you're following a published adventure, what happens during the adventure is unique to your particular experience in that moment.  Moments such as the classic joke \"I'm attacking the darkness!\" seem to come out of almost every session.  On top of that, it's not just a shared story, it's a shared experience that can be touching, moving, filled with despair, sprinkled with moments of wonder, all in a single session.  As humans, we have an almost primal need to tell and hear stories with our fellow companions.  This is just another avenue for that.  RPG's provide useful guidelines for people who aren't natural storytellers or are uncomfortable telling stories.\nIn addition, in our digital age of increasing isolation and fewer meaningful connections with other humans, there's something so incredibly satisfying about spending a couple of hours just talking with other people in-person about something you all, very quickly, become emotionally invested in.\nThe final reason why I love RPG's is they're a chance to escape.  Escape from the day-to-day routine into a fantastic world where you're saving the local town from a dragon or from a killer alien.  It's a chance to become epic.  Which, far too often in our own world means financial status.  For me, having enough money so my survival needs are taken care of is a necessity, but on some level it still feels empty somehow.  If I just saved an entire town from a flood caused by the local villain, it gives me an immense sense of satisfaction.  Just the same as if I were the GM and setting up this scenario and seeing my players overcome the challenges I've laid out.\nSource books\nOr, why a source book can sometimes be better for me than any novel.\nIt all comes down to potential.  A novel, even a fantastic one, is already written.  The story is already known, even if I haven't read it yet.  A good novel for me focuses much more on the world-building aspect.  While I'm reading the story and following the main characters, the rest of my brain is filling in details about the world.  Everything from what's over the ridge that the characters never quite make it over, to the tavern owner that only has a paragraph devoted to her and then isn't mentioned for the rest of the book.  What's her life like?  What other interesting characters has she seen?  Is her tavern successful or does she owe a debt to a sketchy underworld boss?\nA source book provides all the world building I could ever ask for without all the pesky details of a story already written.  It allows my mind to run wild, filling in any details it chooses to.  Some of these have the potential to turn into adventures for my PC's.  Which brings me full circle.  Now it isn't just a story I've made up between the lines of someone else's story, it's now my own story.  One I can share and share in the writing of with friends over many sessions.\nSource books also spark my creativity to life.  Whenever I'm in a creative rut, even if it's not planning for the next session for my PC's, the very act of looking through a source book can spark all of my creativity to life.  No longer am I bored with photography, or woodworking, or any of the many arts I pursue.  That spark has returned and I am, once again, able to create to my heart's content.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/why-i-love-rpg-s/","title":"Why I love RPG's"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/wow/":{"body":"What a vacation... note to self, as someone that always needs to be creating something for his own wellbeing, never take a vacation without a purpose or something to do, otherwise, you'll go crazy!\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/wow/","title":"Wow..."},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/write-it-down-yo/":{"body":"Related to your professional job/career, quickly, what's in your head that isn't in someone else's?  Why haven't you written it down?  No, really, go write that down now.  Even if it's a single sentence.  Have you done it yet?\nHere's a fun test.  Either way, go make yourself come coffee or tea or a sandwich or something that'll force you to context switch.  Now, come back to whatever-it-was you had in your brain.  If you wrote it down, you can easily pick up where you left off.  If not, well, good luck to you.\nHumans have a pretty terrible working memory.  The old adage is 7 +/- 2.  Remember, that's for very simple things.  In business/software/etc we're rarely dealing with simple things.  Communicating those complex ideas to others becomes much easier when we write it down.  It forces us to clarify what we're trying to communicate.  Bonus points if you include pictures or diagrams.\nThis leads me to my next point: if you don't write something down, from your employer's perspective it doesn't exist.  Wait, what?  Yeah.  If anything were to happen to you, that knowledge, all the time spent figuring something out is now gone, wasted.  Remember the last cool idea you had for making something better?  Imagine it gone from the world, permanently.\nFeel that?  Sucks doesn't it?  Now you know what happens every time someone doesn't write something down.  How many ideas, learnings, etc have been lost from the world because no one bothered to write it down?\nNow that more people are working remotely it has exposed one of the greatest business risks: business tribal knowledge.  Or, more explicitly, the fun conversations that happen between employees when they work in the same physical space.  Talking about ideas tends to cement them into more brains than just one.  But, again, if something happens, those ideas disappear.  Working from home is effectively reducing the amount of business tribal knowledge.  Let me be clear, this is a good thing.  Business tribal knowledge is business risk.  Unfortunately, I see far too few people writing down that knowledge in a form that someone else can access which is increasing the business risk even if it's decreasing tribal knowledge.\nIf you want to make a splash at your current (or future) company, write things down as you learn them.  Once you've written them down, make sure they're accessible to others.  Bonus points if you timestamp everything.  Next time your manager or coworker asks you about that-process-that-only-you-know-about, link them to where you wrote down how it works and make yourself available for questions.  BOOM, bonus points.  You've just generated business value and become a force multiplier instead of a roadblock.  It's also something you can bring up when it comes around to review/salary time.\nEven better, when you leave that position, no matter the reason, you're going to leave a much better taste in everyone's mouth when they go to ask you about a thing.  You're no longer there, but there's documentation they can reference.  There's a piece of you still around that's still being helpful.  People tend to remember stuff like that and at worst, you're remembered more fondly.  The business world is a lot smaller than we assume.  People talk, change jobs, and you run into them in the future.\nIn summary, write stuff down, make sure other people can access it, and make the world just a tiny bit better.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/write-it-down-yo/","title":"Write It Down Yo"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/yagni-revisited/":{"body":"\"You aren't gonna need it\" (YAGNI) is a phrase used in software development to help combat complexity and prevent building unnecessary components.  It's a great idea but one rarely implemented.  What I see most often are cron schedulers with api endpoints that put data onto an AWS queue and use an RPC framework internally for no good reason.  I.e., the complete opposite of following the YAGNI principle.\n(fair warning, when I say \"prove\" below I'm not talking about a formal proof, instead research or build enough to convince yourself)\nAssumption of None\nI had an insight the other day that led me down an interesting path.\nOnce you have a problem to work on, but before making any technology choices or writing any code, assume that the problem is already solved.  Assume that you, personally, need to do nothing. \nNo, seriously, assume that you need to do literally nothing to solve that problem.  You sit on your hands and the problem is magically solved in front of your eyes.  Silly right?  Stick with me...\nWhat does this actually mean?  Well, if your problem hasn't been solved in the time it takes you to open a new browser tab, it means that you need to do a quick google search to figure out if someone else has written the thing you think you need.  Even more so, it means thinking about your actual need (hammock driven development for the win!).\nOnce you've done that, prove yourself wrong.  Prove to yourself that no one else has written an app or bit of code that does the thing you need.\nAt this point, you've proven to yourself that no one else has something that fills the need.  Great!  Don't start writing code yet.\nIs there a group of technologies that can integrate with one another to provide the functionality?  Again, assume that there is and see if you can prove yourself wrong.  Nothing exists?  Great!  Now you can start thinking about writing code.\nBut, as you do, continue to make assumptions that you don't need (insert thing here) and prove yourself wrong.  Assume you don't need to persist data until it becomes bleedingly obvious that you do.  Assume you don't need a database to persist that data and a flat file will do, until you can prove that assumption wrong.\nProving assumptions wrong all the way up and down the stack is a great way to prevent yourself from building in something you don't need or using a technology that's too complex for your current use cast.  It's a way to ruthlessly force yourself to build something that's tailored to your situation.\nOther Benefits\nYou know the great thing about building something like that?  It's extensible.  You can always add more on later, after your assumptions prove false.  It improves developer speed, both from a bug-squashing perspective (it should be obvious when there's a bug because your code doesn't do the specific thing you need it to) and from an onboarding perspective.\nI don't necessarily mean a new developer to the company by \"onboarding\" by the way.  I mean getting a developer that's unfamiliar with the codebase up to speed and productive in the codebase.  This includes you if you haven't looked at the codebase in a couple days, by the way!\nThis increases developer productivity which in turn means business velocity.  If you're building the thing you need and only that, you can move at lightning speed.  That's the goal, isn't it?  Move faster than your competition and maintain that velocity for as long as possible.\nYou're also building in a lack of code ownership.  This, contrary to popular belief, is also a good thing.  It means when your code no longer fits your need, because your needs diverged, you can toss the code out and use the lessons learned to move even faster on the new need.  Even in this case, go back to the basic assumption that you don't need to build anything, and prove yourself wrong every step of the way.\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/yagni-revisited/","title":"YAGNI Revisited"},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/year-in-review/":{"body":"Apparently I missed doing one of these last year.  Oh well.  This year has been difficult and challenging and pretty amazing all rolled into one.  First, I read (and listened) to a lot more books than I realized.  That's amazing.  I grew up a voracious reader and somehow got out of the habit.  Needless to say, I think I'm back in the groove and just need to keep up the habit!\nBooks\nAudio\n\nIt Burns (Marc Fennell)\n\nShort and fascinating story about the hottest of the hot peppers.  Sounds boring I know, but I was pretty captivated on my way home from Burning Man by it.\n\n\nExtreme Ownership (Leif Babin, Jocko Willink)\n\nPretty much required reading/listening if you're a leader in any capacity.  The intro and acknowledgements are pretty similar.  Don't hesitate fast forward through those and read them later.  To a non-military person it's very \"hoo-rah\" b.s. that detracts from the actual work itself.\n\n\nThe Dichotomy of Leadership (Leif Babin, Jocko Willink)\n\nWhile it would still make sense without the first book, I'd seriously consider reading Extreme Ownership first because this book builds on the last and does a deeper dive into the nuances of leadership and the balance therein.\n\n\nWhen Breath Becomes Air (Paul Kalanithi)\n\nWow.  This one is a hard read/listen.  Can't recommend it highly enough, but damn.  It really puts into perspective the fragility and strength of being human.\n\n\nCrash Test Girl (Kari Byron)\n\nThis was a great read.  While I hesitate to compare it to Adam Savage's book (they were both MythBusters), it's really fun and I can't get enough of reading biographical-like books.\n\n\nEverything is F*cked (Mark Manson)\n\nHold onto your seats for the (from my perspective) rapid left turn the end of the book makes.  Beyond that, there's a certain cadence to Manson's writing that I really enjoy.\n\n\nEvery Tool's a Hammer (Adam Savage)\n\nCan't say enough good about this book.  Savage is definitely someone I look up to and this is a fun, idiosyncratic look at his process, how he thinks about things, etc.  If nothing else, the chapter on lists and list making was potentially life-changing for me.\n\n\nSpy the Lie (Michael Floyd)\n\nWas a bit disappointed in this sadly.  It's interesting, but I wouldn't go out of my way to re-listen to it.\n\n\n\nDead-Tree\n\nEvery Tool's a Hammer (Adam Savage)\n\nYes, I listened to and read this book.  It's absolutely worth doing both.  I find I get better comprehension and retention by reading but listening to Adam really drove home his passion for making.\n\n\nWhat If? (Randall Munroe)\n\nAnything by Munroe is considered mandatory ready for me.  Smart, funny, and just all around a good time.\n\n\nHow To (Randall Munroe)\n\nSame with this one.  Really hoping that Munroe continues to write books (and XKCD comics!)\n\n\nDeep Work (Cal Newport)\n\nNewport puts into words very eloquently what I've felt for a long time about the kind of work that I do (software development) and exactly why open offices and manager schedules destroy my productivity.\n\n\nStreet Freaks (Terry Brooks)\n\nThe last time I read Terry Brooks was probably in middle or high school with the Shannara books.  This is a complete depart from that to a cyber/bio punk future that I really enjoyed.\n\n\nThe End of Night (Paul Bogard)\n\nVery sad but meaningful read.  Definitely makes you wonder what else we've lost as a society as we've lost the night sky.\n\n\nA Burglar's Guide to the City (Manaugh)\n\nA book that I'd wanted to read for quite some time, but sadly it didn't stick with me.  Definitely some interesting ways of looking at architecture but the book meandered a bit.\n\n\nThe Scene that Became Cities (Caveat Magister)\n\nStarted reading this at Burning Man this year and immediately stopped when I realized what I was doing (spectating instead of participating).  For anyone that wants to learn more about the culture and philosophy that underlies a lot of Burning Man, required reading.\n\n\nOutgrowing God (Richard Dawkins)\n\nHonestly, I was hoping for more with this one.  It felt surprisingly shallow and uninspiring.  I've been slowly distancing myself from \"spiritual\" practices for some time now.  Mostly because I haven't been able to get much out of it.  I was hoping for more of a guide, I guess?\n\n\nPractical Lock Picking (Deviant Ollam)\n\nIf you want to understand locks and how they provide only the facade of security in our world, mandatory reading.  Any talks by Deviant are also incredibly eye-opening and highly recommended.\n\n\nSimple Minded (Daniel Vincennie)\n\nNot entirely sure if this is fiction, half fiction, or non fiction.  It felt like a fever dream and if that was the author's intention, it worked really well.\n\n\nThe Psychedelic Explorer's Guide (James Fadiman)\n\nNot just for psychadelic explorers, but helpful guide for anyone facing a different/difficult/challenging mindset or someone that wants to provide support to someone going through difficult \"stuff\".\n\n\n\nPodcasts\n\nAccuracy Third\n\nThis podcast really got me through the year and was primarily responsible for giving me the confidence to go to Burning Man for the first time.\n\n\nCritical Role\n\nI finally finished Campaign 1!  Looking to Campaign 2... I think I'm going to wait a bit before I dive back in.  Don't get me wrong, I love this podcast, but 3-4 hours per episode means there's not a lot of time for other listening.\n\n\nSomething Else\n\nBrand new podcast, really looking forward to seeing where this goes.\n\n\nMormon and the Meth Head\n\nGot turned onto this one by my significant other.  Haven't had as much time to listen to it as I'd like but it's highly recommended.\n\n\nThe Important Thing\n\nRands in Repose's podcast.  Again, not as much time as I'd like to be able to listen to it.  It'll probably fill in at least some of the time that I was spending on Critical Role.\n\n\n\nCool Stuff Done\n\nBurning Man\n\nReally deserves its own blog post/series.  Amazing and challenging in all the ways I needed.\n\n\n3D Printing\n\nThis is an entire hobby all its own.  Very cool technology that's coming up to the point where it's almost ready for a consumer audience, not just a hobby audience.\n\n\nD&amp;D 5e\n\nContinued playing awesome games with my (now) standard gaming group.  For anyone that hasn't played D&amp;D (or other tabletop role playing game) I highly recommend it.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://bryan-lott.github.io/year-in-review/","title":"2019 Year in Review"}},"docInfo":{"https://bryan-lott.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/2017-recap/":{"body":1516,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/about/":{"body":107,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/bofh/":{"body":351,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/burnout/":{"body":475,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/concurrency-part-2/":{"body":115,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/concurrency/":{"body":111,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/csv-primer/":{"body":560,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/doing-what-you-love/":{"body":309,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/drowning-in-a-sea-of-complexity/":{"body":565,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/etl-tracers/":{"body":658,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/first-responders-sign-language/":{"body":54,"title":5},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/git-commit/":{"body":174,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/goldilocks-and-the-three-company-sizes/":{"body":353,"title":4},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/how-to-read-from-stdin-or-a-file-in-clojure/":{"body":269,"title":4},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/imposter-syndrome/":{"body":190,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/including-the-why/":{"body":222,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/list-of-wonderous-links/":{"body":45,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/music-to-work-by/":{"body":132,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/now/":{"body":37,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/on-python-clojure-and-php/":{"body":265,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard-part-2/":{"body":1245,"title":4},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/onboarding-is-hard/":{"body":601,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/pages/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/predict-the-future-of-your-industry/":{"body":129,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/projects/":{"body":178,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/python-to-scala/":{"body":155,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading-update/":{"body":110,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/reading/":{"body":251,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/refactoring-python-if-statements/":{"body":1021,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/":{"body":19,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/adult-education/":{"body":57,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/bolt-grades/":{"body":112,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/hilift/":{"body":383,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tfc/intro-to-4-wheel-drive/":{"body":70,"title":4},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/the-most-important-skills-for-a-software-developer/":{"body":269,"title":4},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/tools-i-work-with/":{"body":295,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/uses/":{"body":86,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/vacation-is-hard/":{"body":172,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/when-it-s-time-to-move-on/":{"body":632,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/why-i-love-rpg-s/":{"body":562,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/wow/":{"body":19,"title":1},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/write-it-down-yo/":{"body":342,"title":3},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/yagni-revisited/":{"body":370,"title":2},"https://bryan-lott.github.io/year-in-review/":{"body":624,"title":3}},"length":45},"lang":"English"};
